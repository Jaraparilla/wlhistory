<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the first few weeks of 2010, the WikiLeaks website remained down as they concentrated on fundraising and re-vamping their online submission system. A minimum goal of $200,000 was established to keep the organisation running for another year, with a preferred target of $600,000. Some supporters were (again) shocked by WikiLeaks' request for such a large budget, but Julian Assange was anticipating the financial costs of running a global team while maintaining a technical and legal structure that would be strong enough to withstand concerted attacks from major powers. A small-scale operation was never going to survive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s how the WikiLeaks submission system was described in the <a href="https://archive.is/guNLC#selection-2335.0-2335.1291">New Yorker</a> a few months later:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As it now functions, the Web site is primarily hosted on a Swedish Internet service provider called PRQ.se, which was created to withstand both legal pressure and cyber attacks, and which fiercely preserves the anonymity of its clients. Submissions are routed first through PRQ, then to a WikiLeaks server in Belgium, and then on to “another country that has some beneficial laws,” Assange told me, where they are removed at “end-point machines” and stored elsewhere. These machines are maintained by exceptionally secretive engineers, the high priesthood of WikiLeaks. One of them, who would speak only by encrypted chat, told me that Assange and the other public members of WikiLeaks “do not have access to certain parts of the system as a measure to protect them and us.” The entire pipeline, along with the submissions moving through it, is encrypted, and the traffic is kept anonymous by means of a modified version of the Tor network, which sends Internet traffic through “virtual tunnels” that are extremely private. Moreover, at any given time WikiLeaks computers are feeding hundreds of thousands of fake submissions through these tunnels, obscuring the real documents. Assange told me that there are still vulnerabilities, but “this is vastly more secure than any banking network.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In January 2010 Julian Assange was still living in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, which was still in the middle of a major banking crisis (see Chapter Four: Kaupthing Bank). The country&#8217;s major banks had collapsed, owing billions to citizens and foreign investors, and the Central Bank was unable to function as a lender of last resort. Whereas governments in the USA and other countries had bailed out banks with public funds, the banks in Iceland were left to collapse. This caused heavy losses for shareholders and wealthy foreign creditors, who asked their own governments to step in and help. Many of these foreigners were Brits and Danes who had €6.7bn deposited in the "Icesave" branch of the collapsed Landsbanki bank. This lead to a diplomatic dispute between Iceland, the Netherlands and Britain.</p>

In January 2010, the government of Iceland declared that a second version of their Icesave bill would go to a national referendum on 6 March.</p>

<p>During February 2010, WikiLeaks released several more leaked documents about the Icesave scandal. One of them was from Chelsea Manning.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 23 January 2010, Chelsea (then US Army Private Bradley) Manning went back to the USA on leave and ended up stuck in her aunt&#8217;s house in Maryland due to a blizzard. She was carrying huge backups of confidential data but still hadn&#8217;t decided what to do with it. The data included massive tables of "Significant Activities" (SIGACTs) logged by military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Manning routinely analyzed as part of her job. She considered the tables that stored this data "two of the most significant documents of our time."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I began to think about what I knew, and the information I still had in my possession. For me, the SIGACTs represented the on-the-ground reality of both the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I felt we were risking so much for people that seemed unwilling to co-operate with us, leading to frustration and hatred on both sides.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I began to become depressed at the situation that we found ourselves increasingly mired in, year-after-year. The SIGACTs documented this in great detail, and provided context to what we were seeing on-the-ground&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I believed that if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information contained within the CIDNE-I and CIDNE-A tables, this could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general, as well as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan. I also believed that a detailed analysis of the data over a long period of time, by different sectors of society, might cause society to re-evaluate the need, or even the desire to engage in CT [counter-terrorist] and COIN [counter-insurgent] operations that ignored the complex dynamics of the people living in the affected environment each day.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning decided to leak the data to a US newspaper. She called the Washington Post and spoke with a lady who said she was a reporter.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although we spoke for about five minutes concerning the general nature of what I possessed, I do not believe she took me seriously. She informed me that the Washington Post would possibly be interested, but that such decisions are made only after seeing the information I was referring to, and after consideration by senior editors.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning then decided to contact the New York Times, and phoned the public editor&#8217;s number listed on their website.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The phone rang and was answered by a machine. I went through the menu to the section for news tips and was routed to an answering machine. I left a message stating I had access to information about Iraq and Afghanistan that I believed was very important. However, despite leaving my Skype phone number and personal email address, I never received a reply from the New York Times.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning then considered visiting the offices of the influential political blog Politico, but the weather was still too bad. She concluded that WikiLeaks "seemed to be the best medium for publishing this information to the world within my reach." She joined an online chat and said she had "information that needed to be shared with the world". Someone pointed her to the WikiLeaks online submission page.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I considered my options one more time. Ultimately, I felt that the right thing to do was to release the SIGACTs. On 3 February 2010, I visited the WLO website on my computer, and clicked on the "Submit Documents" link.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning uploaded the compressed data files along with a text file that she had prepared for the Washington Post. It said the data had already been "sanitized of any source identifying information."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might need to sit on this information for 90 to 180 days to best send and distribute such a large amount of data to a large audience and protect the source.</p>

<p>On the following day 4 February 2010, WikiLeaks coincidentally <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/8613426708?s=20">tweeted</a> that their minimal funding target of $200,000 had been met: "we’re back fighting for another year, even if we have to eat rice to do it."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/8614240243">tweet</a> about transforming Iceland into a "world centre for investigative media":</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julian Assange was working with Iceland parliamentarians and others on a proposal to turn the island nation into an international "haven" for journalists. On 15 February 2010 he published an article in the Guardian titled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/feb/15/wikileaks-editor-excited-iceland-journalism">why I&#8217;m excited about Iceland&#8217;s plans for journalism</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my role as WikiLeaks editor, I&#8217;ve been involved in fighting off more than 100 legal attacks over the past three years. To do that, and keep our sources safe, we have had to spread assets, encrypt everything, and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve become good at it, and never lost a case, or a source, but we can&#8217;t expect everyone to make such extraordinary efforts. Large newspapers, including the Guardian, are forced to remove or water down investigative stories rather than risk legal costs. Even internet-only publishers writing about corruption find themselves disconnected by their ISPs after legal threats.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange urged Iceland to adopt "the strongest press and source protection laws from around the world" so that it could become a "jurisdiction designed to attract organisations into publishing online". He said the banking sector meltdown had convinced Icelanders that fundamental changes were needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those changes include not just better regulation of banks, but better media oversight of dirty deals between banks and politicians.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI) proposal was adopted unanimously by parliament in June 1010. But the process of reviewing and updating related laws was repeately delayed by political instability. The Prime Minister of Iceland <a href="https://en.immi.is/2019/06/28/immi-at-the-cusp-of-implementation/">aimed</a> to have all the laws finalized and submitted to Parliament before the end of 2019. But by the end of 2020 it seemed the whole project had been indefinitely shelved.</p>

<p>Years later, after Chelsea Manning was arrested for leaking this confidential US data, the USA Army posted to its FOIA "reading room" 13 pages of online chats between Manning, who used the alias "Nobody", and a Wikileaks contact using the alias "Nathaniel Frank". This identity was widely assumed (but never proven) to be Julian Assange; the account might even have been run by multiple WikiLeaks staffers. The chats cover a period from 5 March to 18 March 2010.</p>

<p>The US government would later claim the above exchange as proof that Julian Assange had conspired with Manning to hack into the Pentagon’s classified SIPRNet network. But as Assange&#8217;s lawyers would argue, there&#8217;s no proof Assange was actually the "Nathaniel Frank" identity chatting with Manning, there&#8217;s no proof they cracked the password (it seems unlikely: Manning didn&#8217;t even know if the hash was right). In any case, as US prosecutors admitted, Manning already had security clearances to legally access the SIPRNet material. She could simply have been engineering an anonymous login to help protect her identity, or even just to install video games, films and music videos (as a <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2021/07/19/why-the-crumbling-computer-conspiracy-case-is-so-vital-to-the-us/">forensic examiner</a> later suggested).

<p>According to a later report in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/no-secrets">New Yorker</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange regarded the report as a declaration of war, and posted it with the title “U.S. Intelligence Planned to Destroy WikiLeaks.”</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks posted the file with the following editorial summary, noting how the report in many ways justified WikiLeaks' activities:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document is a classified (SECRET/NOFORN) 32 page U.S. counterintelligence investigation into WikiLeaks. "The possibility that current employees or moles within DoD or elsewhere in the U.S. government are providing sensitive or classified information to WikiLeaks.org cannot be ruled out." It concocts a plan to fatally marginalize the organization. Since WikiLeaks uses "trust as a center of gravity by protecting the anonymity and identity of the insiders, leakers or whistleblowers", the report recommends "The identification, exposure, termination of employment, criminal prosecution, legal action against current or former insiders, leakers, or whistleblowers could potentially damage or destroy this center of gravity and deter others considering similar actions from using the WikiLeaks.org Web site". [As two years have passed since the date of the report, with no WikiLeaks source exposed, it appears that this plan was ineffective]. As an odd justification for the plan, the report claims that "Several foreign countries including China, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe have denounced or blocked access to the WikiLeaks.org website". The report provides further justification by enumerating embarrassing stories broken by WikiLeaks---U.S. equipment expenditure in Iraq, probable U.S. violations of the Chemical Warfare Convention Treaty in Iraq, the battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah and human rights violations at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>The news of the upcoming Collateral Murder video caused a stir of global media anticipation, making it harder for the US govenment to censor the release. But many people were also surprised to hear that Assange had attended a cocktail party at the US Embassy. How did that happen?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange was still working with a team of Icelandic journalists and political activists. One of them, Birgitta Jónsdóttir, had received an invitation to a cocktail party at the local US embassy.

Jónsdóttir decided not to go; Assange went alone.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 29 March 2010, WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/U.S._Embassy_profiles_on_Icelandic_PM,_Foreign_Minister,_Ambassador">released</a> three classified cables that were authored by US diplomat Sam Watson, head of the US Embassy in Iceland, who had been personally chatting with Assange at the cocktail party just a few months earlier.

<h3 id="_collateral_murder">Collateral Murder</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 12 July 2007, two US military Apache helicopters conducted a series of air strikes on a group of civilians in Baghdad, Iraq. At least twelve people were killed, including two Reuters journalists, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen. Two children were also badly wounded. The pilots later claimed they that thought their victims were Iraqi insurgents, after mistaking the shadow of a long camera lens held by Noor-Eldeen for a rocket-propelled granade (RPG). Reuters chiefs had spent years seeking access to the full US military video of the attacks without success. The USA insisted their soldiers had acted in accordance with the rules of war and their own official "Rules of Engagement".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 5 April 2010 WikiLeaks <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">released</a> both the original 38 minute video and a shorter 17 minute version which had been carefully edited to provide context and analysis. Both versions included subtitles based on the helicopters' radio transmissions. WikiLeaks titled their release "Collateral Murder", which outraged those who insisted the attacks did not amount to a war crime. WikiLeaks also released the US military&#8217;s classified Rules of Engagement for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as evidence that the 2007 incident did not fit these rules "before, during, and after the killings".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later that month the New Yorker published a lengthy <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/no-secrets">feature</a> by Raffi Khatchadourian, who had been given extensive access to "the Bunker" - a rented house in Iceland where the WikiLeaks team had worked day and night to prepare this release. He said it took WikiLeaks three months to decode the encrypted video, which Assange called "moderately difficult". To ensure the video stayed online, the team had contacted Google to confirm they would not censor the footage under YouTube&#8217;s "gratuitious violence" policy. Hoping to catch the US Defense Department unprepared, Assange also "encouraged a rumor that the video was shot in Afghanistan in 2009". And with the help of Iceland’s national broadcasting service, RUV, Assange sent two journalists to Baghdad, to contact the families of the Iraqis who had died in the attack, to prepare them for the media attention, and to gather additional information.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Late Saturday night, shortly before all the work had to be finished, the journalists who had gone to Baghdad sent Assange an e-mail: they had found the two children in the van. The children had lived a block from the location of the attack, and were being driven to school by their father that morning. “They remember the bombardment, felt great pain, they said, and lost consciousness,” one of the journalists wrote. The journalists also found the owner of the building that had been attacked by the Hellfires, who said that families had been living in the structure, and that seven residents had died. The owner, a retired English teacher, had lost his wife and daughter.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s how Assange described the video:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“In this video, you will see a number of people killed. In the first phase, you will see an attack that is based upon a mistake, but certainly a very careless mistake. In the second part, the attack is clearly murder, according to the definition of the average man. And in the third part you will see the killing of innocent civilians in the course of soldiers going after a legitimate target.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“This video shows what modern warfare has become, and, I think, after seeing it, whenever people hear about a certain number of casualties that resulted during fighting with close air support, they will understand what is going on. The video also makes clear that civilians are listed as insurgents automatically, unless they are children, and that bystanders who are killed are not even mentioned.”</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>US military records stated that everyone killed in the incident, except for the Reuters journalists, was an insurgent. They could not explain how the children were injured. Such innocent victims of war are routinely dismissed as "collateral damage". Assange decided to call the film “Collateral Murder" to help "knock out this ‘collateral damage’ euphemism".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a massive global response to the leak, triggering a prolonged debate about war crimes, the War in Iraq, US empiricism, and the US military&#8217;s rules of engagement. Exactly what Chelsea Manning had said she wanted. "WikiLeaks" quickly became the world&#8217;s top search term; a Huffington Post article on Collateral Murder got over ten thousand comments in a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Twitter, WikiLeaks noted that many apologists were focussing debate on whether confusing a camera for an RPG was justified, while ignoring the murderous attack on the van. Others were falsely claiming that WikiLeaks had doctored the video to make the soldiers look bad. Assange repeatedly insisted that permission to kill was given before the word "RPG" was even mentioned. He acknowledged that some people in the Iraqi group were armed, but pointed out that this was not abnormal in a dangerous war zone, and nobody in the group was behaving in a hostile manner.</p>

<p>US Defence Secretary Robert Gates was not a happy man. He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63C53M20100413">complained</a> that the video provided a view of warfare "as seen through a soda straw".</p>

<p>Reuters boss David Schlesinger was also not happy. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/apr/21/war-journalists-right-safety">complained</a> that the US military had only shown Reuters editors the first portion of the video, insisting that their journalists had been in the company of armed insurgents. As a result, Reuters had instructed their journalists to never even walk near armed groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"However, we were not shown the second part of the video, where the helicopter fired on a van trying to evacuate the wounded&#8230;&#8203; We have been trying for more than two and a half years to get this video from the military through formal legal means without success, and in fact have an appeal to their last denial of our request still pending; now it transpires that officials who repeatedly told us that what the video contained was important enough for security reasons to withhold it from us, made no efforts to secure it and weren&#8217;t even clear where it was. It took a whistleblower to make sure the world had the transparency it needed and deserved."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks accused the US military of making “numerous false or misleading statements” in the wake of the release and posted additional classified material to counter lies about the attack. WikiLeaks also complained about the lack of follow-up stories in the media in the weeks following the release. One <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/12991995785?s=20">tweet</a> linked to an extraordinary <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/04/emcc-a28.html">interview</a> with a US soldier, Ethan McCord, who was seen in the video assisting the wounded children. WikiLeaks said it was "just incredible" that it was left to sites like the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS: "the online publication of the world Trotskyist movement") to run such important stories.</p>

<p>Ethan McCord and Josh Stieber, both soldiers from Bravo Company 2-16 (the ground team shown in the video), had written a “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100421033736if_/http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5966/p/dia/action/public/index.sjs?action_KEY=2724">Letter of Reconciliation</a>” to the Iraqi people.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After rescuing the children, McCord was told to “stop worrying about these motherfucking kids and start worrying about pulling security.” After returning to base, wiping the children&#8217;s blood from his armour, and complaining about mental health stress, McCord (who had children of his own back home) was ordered to “quit being a pussy” and to “suck it up and be a soldier.” He was threatened with being labeled a “malingerer” which is a crime in the US Army. After again requesting mental health assistance a week later, McCord was told by his superior officers: "get the sand out of your vagina&#8230;&#8203; suck it up and be a soldier" After speaking out in April 2010, McCord received regular <a href="https://www.worldcantwait.net/index.php/wikileaks/7635-ethan-mccord-receives-death-threats">death theats</a> from his former fellow soldiers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By 2019, the Collateral Murder video had been viewed on Youtube over 16 million times. Many were surprised to learn that the a Washington Post reporter, David Finkel, had been sitting on a copy of the video, which he had shown to people in his own home but never released. Finkel defended his decision, saying: “There were a lot of bad days in Iraq.” Assange <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/julian-assange-the-rolling-stone-interview-234403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Finkel "had clearly developed too close an affinity for the people he was embedded with and came out essentially campaigning on their behalf after the release of the video".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to Khatchadourian, WikiLeaks received more than two hundred thousand dollars in donations after releasing "Collateral Murder”, prompting Assange to tweet: “New funding model for journalism: try doing it for a change.” That tweet was later deleted, a sign of WikiLeaks' enduring frustration with other media organisations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange also explained to Khatchadourian his vision for "scientific journalism", insisting on the value of verifiabale source documents like the Collateral Murder video:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“If you publish a paper on DNA, you are required, by all the good biological journals, to submit the data that has informed your research - the idea being that people will replicate it, check it, verify it. So this is something that needs to be done for journalism as well. There is an immediate power imbalance, in that readers are unable to verify what they are being told, and that leads to abuse.”</p>

<p>Through April 2010 Julian Assange continued doing interviews to promote WikiLeaks and public discussion of their latest leak.</p>

<p>On 12 April he was in <a href="https://archive.is/Q6UrR">New York City</a> for an appearance on <a href="https://www.cc.com/video/q1yz2t/the-colbert-report-julian-assange">The Colbert Show</a>. Comedian Stephen Colbert appeared with his face pixellated on TV, then suggested that maybe Assange&#8217;s face should be the one pixellated instead. But Assange&#8217;s face had already been shown on screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Oh well, he&#8217;s a dead man."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cue the laughter. Colbert then challenged Assange about using the provocative title "Collateral Murder", claiming “that’s not leaking that’s pure editorial.” But Assange again insisted that "permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used." The <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/apr/14/julian-assange/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-tells-colbert-per/">Politifact</a> website later rated the claim only "half true" because "while Assange&#8217;s statement is technically accurate, we think it leaves out critical context".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The promise we make to our sources," Assange explained to Colbert, "is that not only will we defend them with every means that we have available, technological, and legally, and politically, but we will try to get the maximum possible political impact for the material they give to us.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“If we don’t know what the government is doing, we can’t be sad about it," argued Colbert. "Why are you trying to make me sad?"</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A weeks later Assange <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10373176">appeared</a> as a panelist at a seminar on free speech held in the European Parliament. He said WikiLeaks had tried to contact the US government to open dialogue about the leaks, without any response. WikiLeaks had also engaged lawyers to support their alleged source.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The signals from the US authorities initially were mixed, however, they seem to clarifying now and I think the United States understands that it must obey the rule of law."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another week later, the 38-year-old WikiLeaks founder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smMBZvBQXfc">appeared</a> on Swedish TV, explaining how WikiLeaks differed from other media organisations:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The aim of WikiLeaks is to achieve just reform around the world, and do it through the mechanism of transparency. Now of course many groups have that aim, but our particular view&#8230;&#8203; is to selectively go after material that is concealed. Because organisations that have material, and want to conceal it, are giving off a signal that they believe there will be reform if that material is released.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He said WikiLeaks also aimed to "facilitate a greater worldwide atmosphere of openness, and protection for the rights of people to publish information". The organisation&#8217;s long-term goal was to "put the civil into Civilisation" and build up an "historical and intellectual record" of how civilisation in different countries works in practice. "With that information, better decisions can be made" by people regardless of their ideology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said WikiLeaks also wanted to "produce an environment where the press is protected, and publishing is protected, and to make that a standard and a norm."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"At the moment we are seeing globalisation between the legal regimes of many different countries&#8230;&#8203; There is going to be a harmonisation of laws that apply to information transfer. So that means there is going to be a new standard for freedom of speech. What is it to be? It&#8217;s up in the air."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange, an admirer of Swedish laws on free speech, suggested the Swedish Constitution could help inform debate on new global standards for information technology. WikiLeaks servers were hosted by a Swedish ISP because of the strong legal protections available in that country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said WikiLeaks was now seen as a "publisher of last resort" who could publish things others could not, and that this revealed a "weakness in the global publishing landscape".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"There is NOT a truly free press. It has never actually existed. We in the West have deluded ourselves into believing that we actually have a truly free press. We don&#8217;t. And we can see that in the difference between what WikiLeaks does and what the rest of the press does&#8230;&#8203;"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Through privatisation, we have had many government functions being run by corporations. And now we see the function of censorship has also been privatised. What that means is that litigious billionaires and big companies are able to effectively prevent certain things appearing in public&#8230;&#8203; by using the legal system or patronage networks and economic flows to make it unprofitable to talk about certain things&#8230;&#8203; In the UK at the moment there are three hundred secret gag orders."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In early May 2010 Julian Assange returned home to his native Australia, where polls showed he enjoyed huge public support. His passport was <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/technology/australian-wikileak-founders-passport-confiscated-20100516-v6dw.html">confiscated</a> by customs officers at Melbourne Airport, but returned after 15 minutes. He was told the passport was "looking worn" and it would be cancelled soon. An Australian Federal Police officer then searched one of his bags and asked about his hacking conviction from 1991.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange had quickly become a global celebrity. He did a lengthy <a href="https://archive.is/GNEzr">SBS Dateline</a> interview - followed by an online Q and A session - with award-winning journalist Mark Davis, who had previously met him in Norway, Sweden and Iceland. For Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, everything was looking positive.</p>

<p>Back in Iraq, however, Chelsea Manning was still struggling with gender identity issues, military life, and anxiety about her recent leaks. She had only two months duty remaining in Iraq before she could return to the USA, where she wanted to get out of the Army and begin transitioning from male to female. Desperate for support from a like-minded soul, she reached out to Adrian Lamo, a bisexual hacker with a history of homelessness and drug abuse. Lamo had been convicted in 2004 after famously hacking The New York Times, Yahoo! and Microsoft. Manning assumed she could trust him, because he had donated to WikiLeaks (see Chapter Four). She was wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, Lamo was still struggling with his own demons. In April 2010, Lamo&#8217;s father repeatedly phoned police to warn that Lamo was over-medicating with the drugs he had been proscribed since his 2003 arrest. Lamo later <a href="https://archive.is/wWEL">insisted</a> that he was the one who called police, complaining that someone had stolen his medication. In any case, he ended up in the back of an ambulance, and was placed on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold under California state law, just a few weeks before Chelsea Manning reached out to him. He was discharged on 7 May with a diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome, a mild form of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</p>

<p>Lamo chatted online with Manning for several days from 21 May 2010. He saved their conversations in four files. Then he handed these files over to US government agents. Within a week, Chelsea Manning was arrested.</p>

<p>Many WikiLeaks critics later blamed Julian Assange for not protecting his source, but it was actually Chelsea Manning whose poor opsec put WikiLeaks at risk.

<p>Adrian Lamo contacted an old friend, Chet Uber, the founder of a "White Hat" computer security group called Project Vigilant. Uber then <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/firewall/2010/08/01/stealthy-government-contractor-monitors-u-s-internet-providers-says-it-employed-wikileaks-informant/?sh=760cfc9bafd3">contacted</a> Mark Rasch, a former head of the US Justice Department&#8217;s computer crime unit and "General Counsel" to that same Project Vigilant group. Four US government agents soon arrived at Lamo&#8217;s house to scrutinize the logs he had saved.</p>

<p>Chelsea Manning was arrested in Iraq on 27 May 2010 and sent to "pre-trial confinement" in Kuwait, where she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/27/anniversary-chelsea-manning-arrest-war-diaries">"essentially lived in a cage"</a> inside a hot tent for nearly two months. Guards told her she woud be sent to the Guantánamo Bay prison or some other secret interrogation site.</p>

<p>Manning was transferred to the USA, where she suffered further torture at the Marines' Quantico Brig in Virginia, on 29 July 2010.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>News of Chelsea Manning&#8217;s arrest was first <a href="https://archive.is/gsvu5">reported</a> by WIRED magazine on 6 June 2010, ten days after her actual arrest.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning was turned in late last month by a former computer hacker with whom he spoke online. In the course of their chats, Manning took credit for leaking a headline-making video of a helicopter attack that Wikileaks posted online in April. The video showed a deadly 2007 U.S. helicopter air strike in Baghdad that claimed the lives of several innocent civilians.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He said he also leaked three other items to Wikileaks: a separate video showing the notorious 2009 Garani air strike in Afghanistan that Wikileaks has previously acknowledged is in its possession; a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat, which the site posted in March; and a previously unreported breach consisting of 260,000 classified U.S. diplomatic cables that Manning described as exposing “almost criminal political back dealings.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Hillary Clinton [then US Secretary Of State], and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning, and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available, in searchable format, to the public,” Manning wrote.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adrian Lamo was not named as the source of the WIRED exclusive, even though he had a close existing relationship with WIRED editor Kevin Poulsen, who had also previously been <a href="https://unsolved.com/gallery/kevin-poulsen/">convicted of hacking</a> as a teenager (in 1994, after pleading guilty to mail, wire and computer fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice, Poulsen was sentenced to 51 months in prison with $56,000 fines). Interestingly, the guy who sent the agents to Lamo&#8217;s house, Mark Rasch, had also been involved in the investigation of Poulsen, leading many observers to later speculate that both Lamo and Poulsen had been "flipped".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the next day 7 June 2010, the BBC published an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10255887">interview</a> with Lamo:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"A lot of people have labelled me a snitch. I guess I deserve that on this one but not as a generality. This was a very hard decision for me."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Citing his previous arrest for hacking, Lamo said he "felt the need to contact investigators" because Manning&#8217;s approach was "basically a suicide pact."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I was worried for my family - that if I were obstructing justice that they could be caught up in any investigation. I wanted to do this one by the book, by the numbers. I didn&#8217;t want any more FBI agents knocking at the door."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I want to be proud of it but I can&#8217;t bring myself to be. I keep thinking about what it was like being 22, alone and not knowing about my future. Knowing that I did that to somebody - it hurts. I feel like I should be talking to a priest."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I hope that Manning gets the same chance as I did - the same chance to take his punishment as I did and start a new life as I did. I like to think I prevented him from getting into more serious trouble."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In following weeks, however, Lamo&#8217;s interviews were increasingly full of contradictions and even blatant lies. The carefully selected portions of the Manning-Lamo chatlogs that were released by US media outlets had a clear bias against Manning and Assange. There was no mention of Assange&#8217;s efforts to protect Manning, for example, or Lamo&#8217;s broken promises of confidentiality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is quite likely that WikiLeaks did not know for sure if Manning was the source of their leaks, because they had worked hard to keep her identity a secret, even from themselves.</p>

The Garani massacre video (mentioned above) was leaked by Manning to WikiLeaks but never released. A US Air Force B-1 Bomber attacked the village of Garani, Afghanistan on 4 May 2009. Julian Assange claimed "over 80 children&#8230;&#8203; and more than 100 people" died. The USA admitted "the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimize accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties". Assange later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5n58sm/i_am_julian_assange_founder_of_wikileaks_ask_me/dc8piiv/">blamed Sweden</a> for seizing "the only copy we had" on September 27, 2010 but WikiLeaks previously "had other copies and they were also attacked".

<p>WIRED continued writing negative stories about WikiLeaks, which were picked up by other media organisations, with no hard proof to confirm them. Based on a paragraph from Khatchadourian&#8217;s New Yorker article, WIRED claimed WikiLeaks had obtained their original cache of over a million documents "through an eavesdropping operation on the Tor network". Wikileaks said the story was a "beatup" with "no new info" then clarified even further: "Wired&#8217;s Tor claims are untrue. The Alweys document [WikiLeaks' first published leak] did not come from tor. We do not monitor tor, etc".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When WikiLeaks failed to renew a website SSL certificate, causing their submission page to temporarily go offline, WIRED published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225122212/https://www.wired.com/2010/06/wikileaks-submission/">lengthy attack</a> by Ryan Singel titled "With World Watching, Wikileaks Falls Into Disrepair". WikiLeaks again denied the story and said they were just "upgrading infrastructure to deal with growth".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, Manning&#8217;s disclosure of further leaks in the WikiLeaks pipeline was causing serious panic in Washington. On 10 June a former New York Times reporter <a href="https://archive.is/I88DB#selection-1737.0-1755.72">wrote</a> that ”Pentagon investigators” were trying “to determine the whereabouts of the Australian-born founder of the secretive website Wikileaks for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified State Department cables that, if made public, could do serious damage to national security.” Salon.com journalist Glenn Greewald noted that there was a “Pentagon manhunt” underway for Assange - "as though he’s some sort of dangerous fugitive".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the end of 2010, progressive media sites had <a href="https://shadowproof.com/merged-manning-lamo-chat-logs/">documented</a> numerous problems with comments from Lamo, WIRED editors, and the published sections of the chatlogs. In late December 2010 Glenn Greenwald <a href="https://www.salon.com/2010/12/27/wired_5/">demanded to know</a> why Poulsen was still hiding the full chatlogs and allowing media speculation to run wild.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Poulsen&#8217;s concealment of the chat logs is actively blinding journalists and others who have been attempting to learn what Manning did and did not do. By allowing the world to see only the fraction of the Manning-Lamo chats that he chose to release, Poulsen has created a situation in which his long-time "source," Adrian Lamo, is the only source of information for what Manning supposedly said beyond those published exceprts.  Journalists thus routinely print Lamo&#8217;s assertions about Manning&#8217;s statements even though - as a result of Poulsen&#8217;s concealment - they are unable to verify whether Lamo is telling the truth.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"To see how odious Poulsen&#8217;s concealment of this evidence is, consider this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/world/16wiki.html">December 15 New York Times article by Charlie Savage</a>, which reports that the DOJ is trying to prosecute WikiLeaks based on the theory that Julian Assange "encouraged or even helped" Manning extract the classified information.  Savage extensively quotes Lamo claiming that Manning told him all sorts of things about WikiLeaks and Assange that are not found in the portions of the chat logs published by Wired."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the time WIRED finally published the full Lamo-Manning chatlogs in July 2011, a false media narrative had been firmly established whereby Julian Assange had somehow helped Manning "hack" into US government networks and "steal" confidential material, thus "putting lives at risk". The actual chatlogs proved the opposite: WikiLeaks took great pains to protect their source, verify the material, and publish it responsibly. WIRED editor Evin Hansen <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bradley-manning-traitor-hero_b_898789">claimed</a> that the magazine had held material back publishing the full chatlogs "out of respect for Manning’s privacy". This was hard to believe, given that most of the withheld sections had nothing at all to do with Manning&#8217;s personal life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Glenn Greenwald concluded:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concern was that Wired was concealing material to glorify and shield its source, Poulsen&#8217;s long-time associate Adrian Lamo, in a way that distorted the truth and, independently, denied the public important context for what happened here. Wired&#8217;s release of the full chat logs leaves no doubt that those concerns were justified, and that Wired was less than honest about what it was concealing.</p>

<p>News of Chelsea Manning&#8217;s arrest followed the April 2010 indictment of NSA whistle-blower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Drake">Thomas Drake</a> and the May 2010 sentencing of an FBI translator, Shamai K. Leibowitz, who received 20 months in prison for providing classified documents to a blogger. It triggered an angry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/us/politics/12leak.html">article</a> in the New York Times on 15 June 2010:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"In 17 months in office, President Obama has already outdone every previous president in pursuing leak prosecutions.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The article quoted Steven Aftergood, head of a project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, saying that both major US parties now felt leaks had gotten out of hand and needed to be deterred.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“I think this administration, like every other administration, is driven to distraction by leaking. And Congress wants a few scalps, too. On a bipartisan basis, they want these prosecutions to proceed.”</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Justice Department had just renewed a subpoena in a case involving The New York Times reporter James Risen, whose 2006 book “State of War” described a bungled US attempt to disrupt Iran’s nuclear program. Risen&#8217;s source, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, would be indicted seven months later for unauthorized disclosure of national defense information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Obama administration was repeatedly turning to the Espionage Act of 1917 to pursue such leaks, drawing strong criticism for their select interpretation of antiquated World War One laws in a new world of online communications. But what was the alternative?</p>

<p>On 18 June 2010 WikiLeaks <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/16468709105?s=20">tweeted</a> that a new US cyber-censorship bill appeared to be "aimed at WikiLeaks". The tweet linked to a Daily Beast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100811183601/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-18/new-bill-would-let-obama-police-internet-for-national-security-reasons/?cid=hp:exc">story</a> titled "Can Obama Shut Down the Internet?"</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new bill rocketing through Congress would give the president sweeping powers to police the Web for national-security reasons. Could this be a way to block WikiLeaks?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bill would grant President Obama the power to declare a “national cyber-emergency” at his discretion and force private companies tied to the Web, including Internet service providers and search engines, to take action in response—moves that could include limiting or even cutting off their connections to the World Wide Web for up to 30 days.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Critics said the bill would give the US President a "Kill Switch" for the Internet, and pointed out that this sort of behaviour was regularly condemned by the USA when regimes like China did it. As if to prove the point, on 28 June 2010 the Thai government blocked access to wikileaks.org. And in Britain, the National Union of Journalists was <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/story/2010/06/25/journalists-unite-to-stop-uk-digital-economy-act-and-isps-blocking-legitimate-sites.html">challenging</a> the new Digital Economy Act, which could be used against websites that publish material of public interest without permission (e.g. WikiLeaks).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After widespread criticism, the proposed US government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_Cyberspace_as_a_National_Asset_Act">Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act</a> of 2010 was never voted into existence. But over the next ten years a whole raft of new laws like this would be introduced around the world, severely limiting civil rights and online freedoms in the name of "national security".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was the urgent debate about a "new standard for freedom of speech" that Julian Assange - and before him the Cypherpunks - had long been warning about. Which way would the world swing: towards "a growing, expanding crypto anarchy" (to repeat Tim May&#8217;s words from 1996) or an increasingly dystopian authoritarianism?</p>
