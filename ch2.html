<p>WikiLeaks published its first leaked document <a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Inside_Somalia_and_the_Union_of_Islamic_Courts">Inside Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts</a> on 26 December 2006. The leak was described as "a secret Islamic order, purportedly written by the most important man in the Union, Sheik Aweys, [which] proclaims an Islamic Republic of Somalia." The final line of the leaked document stated:</p>

<p>"Whosoever leaks this information and is found guilty should be shot".</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks provided extensive analysis to support the publication, including detailed speculation about whether it was genuine. WikiLeaks later called it "a play for Chinese support" but said "our Chinese source gives us little on the credibility". The document, which received limited media attention, was originally posted online as a .zip file because the WikiLeaks.org site was still not live. It was later described as a "Sample Document".</p>

<h3 id="_early_media_coverage">Early Media Coverage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On January 11 2007 AFP published an article titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081113/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Media/Chinese_WikiLeaks_Aids_Whistleblowers">Chinese cyber-dissidents launch WikiLeaks, a site for whistleblowers</a>. It was the first time Julian Assange, described as "a cryptographer and member of the advisory board", was publicly linked with the new organisation:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Our primary interests are oppressive regimes in Asia, the former Soviet bloc, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, but we also expect to be of assistance to those in the West who wish to reveal unethical behaviour in their own governments and corporations," says the site WikiLeaks (www.wikileaks.org).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An official for WikiLeaks in Washington, identifying himself as Julian Assange, told AFP on Wednesday that the group hoped to go online from March but had been "discovered" before its launch and was not fully prepared for the publicity it was now receiving.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The New Scientist article <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407907601006">How to leak a secret and not get caught</a> was published in their monthly print edition two days later. The online version remains paywalled but a free version can be <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Media/How_to_leak_a_secret_and_not_get_caught">found</a> on wikileaks.org. Author Paul Marks was intrigued by the new organisation&#8217;s security technology:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally an email or a document posted to a website can be traced back to its source because each data packet carries the IP address of the last server that it passed through. To prevent this, WikiLeaks will exploit an anonymising protocol known as The Onion Router (Tor), which routes data through a network of servers that use cryptography to hide the path that the packets took.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact the ingenious WikiLeaks "anonymous drop box" would utilize more encryption security than just <a href="torproject.org">Tor</a>, and would be regularly upgraded (or even taken offline) to protect sources. The unique and original concept behind this technology, which guaranteed anonymity to people on both sides of the submission system, was in many ways the key to WikiLeaks' success. Eventually it would become a submissions model copied by major news organisations worldwide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks boasted that they had already received "over 1.1 million documents so far from dissident communities and anonymous sources." Some people speculated that these documents were merely encrypted files copied from a server on the Tor network and this was more evidence of "Splendide Mendax" at work. As mentioned in the New Scientist article, Tor network security had already been breached a few times (leading to improvements) so WikiLeaks may have been able to decrypt or otherwise acquire the contents. But their claim certainly helped get media attention and build support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, the New Scientist article shows how many tough editorial decisions Assange and his team still had to make:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks team do not plan to control what is disclosed on the site, raising fears that the anonymity it offers could be misused. "The initiative could drown in fabricated documents, pornographic records or become hijacked to serve vendettas," warns Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington DC.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The safeguard against this, according to the WikiLeaks team, is that false postings will be sniffed out by users, who will be free to comment on what is posted. This is what happens with Wikipedia, which although unconnected to WikiLeaks is based on the same open-source software. "WikiLeaks will provide a forum for the entire global community to examine any document relentlessly for credibility," the site claims.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks is raising funds and testing its software. It hopes to launch in February.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A flurry of other news stories followed in multiple languages from media sites around the world. Even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071211125150/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Media/Freedom_of_Information_the_Wiki_Way">Washington Post</a> was interested:</p>

<p>The thought that a nation&#8217;s defense plans could turn up as "you&#8217;ve got mail" across the globe is a chilling one. So, too, is the potential for a miscreant to sow mayhem by "leaking" documents, real or fake.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general media consensus was cautiously optimistic. But critical comments from Cryptome&#8217;s John Young, who had helped Assange secure the WikiLeaks.org domain, were a regular feature.  As mentioned in the previous chapter, Young had decided that WikiLeaks was moving too fast, asking for too much money, and was maybe even a CIA front. Others began speculating that Mossad, Russia, or some other state actor could be involved. Young wrote to Assange:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Fuck your cute hustle and disinformation campaign. Same old shit, working for the enemy&#8230;&#8203; Fuck ’em all.”</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange replied cryptically:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“We are going to fuck them all. Chinese mostly but not entirely a feint.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Young disassociated himself from the project and <a href="https://cryptome.org/wikileaks/wikileaks-leak.htm">posted</a> on his website all the WikiLeaks correspondence he could find, from December 2006 and to early January 2007. In 2010, he also <a href="https://marc.info/?a=90366091900010">published</a> Assange’s contributions to the Cypherpunks mailing list between 1995 and 2002.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On January 22 2007 TIME magazine famously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071212140735/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Media/A_Wiki_for_Whistle-Blowers">stated</a> that WikiLeaks "could become as important a journalistic tool as the Freedom of Information Act". But they warned readers to remains sceptical and even hoped that someone might "find the smoking gun that reveals what shadowy organization is behind Wikileaks". Hardened cynics in the media and intelligence communities struggled to accept the simple truth: WikiLeaks was Julian Assange&#8217;s own invention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks team originally tried to keep track of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071211082105/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:Recent_Media">new media articles</a> but soon gave up due to limited resources and overwhelming global interest.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in the history of WikiLeaks, the original version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070202031222/http://wikileaks.org/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> (FAQ) page is well worth reading. Wikileaks is described as "an uncensorable version of Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis [which] combines the protection and anonymity of cutting-edge cryptographic technologies with the transparency and simplicity of a wiki interface."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a clear intention to revolutionize journalism and change the world for the better:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What official will chance a secret, corrupt transaction when the public is likely to find out? What repressive plan will be carried out when it is revealed to the citizenry, not just of its own country, but the world? When the risks of embarrassment through openness and honesty increase, the tables are turned against conspiracy, corruption, exploitation and oppression&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Wikileaks provides simple and straightforward means for anonymous and untraceable leaking of documents.</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, Wikileaks opens leaked documents up to a much more exacting scrutiny than any media organization or intelligence agency could provide: the scrutiny of a worldwide community of informed wiki editors.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was also a clear intention to challenge and compete with corrupt intelligence agencies worldwide:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wikileaks may become the most powerful "intelligence agency" on earth&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an intelligence agency of the people. It will be an open source, democratic intelligence agency. But it will be far more principled, and far less parochial than any governmental intelligence agency; consequently, it will be more accurate, and more relevant. It will have no commercial or national interests at heart; its only interests will be truth and freedom of information. Unlike the covert activities of state intelligence agencies, Wikileaks will rely upon the power of overt fact to inform citizens about the truths of their world.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wikileaks will be the outlet for every government official, every bureaucrat, every corporate worker, who becomes privy to embarrassing information which the institution wants to hide but the public needs to know. What conscience cannot contain, and institutional secrecy unjustly conceals, Wikileaks can broadcast to the world.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original vision for the website was very much based on the "wiki" software developed in the mid 1990s. Organisations around the world were actively embracing it but Wikipedia was by far the most successful and publicly recognisable model. The WikiLeaks FAQ declared: "What Wikipedia is to the encyclopedia, Wikileaks will be to leaks." And even more ambitiously: "We plan to numerically eclipse the content of the English Wikipedia with leaked documents."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To the user, Wikileaks will look very much like Wikipedia. Anybody can post to it, anybody can edit it. No technical knowledge is required. Leakers can post documents anonymously and untraceably. Users can publicly discuss documents and analyze their credibility and veracity. Users can discuss interpretations and context and collaboratively formulate collective publications. Users can read and write explanatory articles on leaks along with background material and context. The political relevance of documents and their verisimilitude will be revealed by a cast of thousands.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wikileaks will also incorporate advanced cryptographic technologies for anonymity and untraceability. Those who provide leaked information may face severe risks, whether of political repercussions, legal sanctions or physical violence. Accordingly, extremely sophisticated mathematical and cryptographic techniques will be used to secure privacy, anonymity and untraceability.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the technically minded, Wikileaks integrates technologies including modified versions of FreeNet, Tor, PGP and software of our own design.</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wikileaks will be deployed in a way that makes it impervious to political and legal attacks. In this sense it is uncensorable.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks FAQ said 22 people were "currently directly involved in the project". A prototype submissions system had been successfully tested but was not ready for a full public deployment: they hoped to go live in February or March 2007. They called for additional funding and support, including "volunteer editors/analysts and server operators."</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concerns about privacy, irresponsibility and false information also arise with Wikipedia. On Wikipedia, irresponsible posting or editing of material, or posting of false material, can be reversed by other users, and the results have been extremely satisfying and reassuring. There is no reason to expect any different from Wikileaks. Indeed, as discovered with Wikipedia to the surprise of many, the collective wisdom of an informed community of users may provide rapid and accurate dissemination, verification and analysis.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, misleading leaks and misinformation are already well placed in the mainstream media, as recent history shows, an obvious example being the lead-up to the Iraq war. Peddlers of misinformation will find themselves undone by Wikileaks, equipped as it is to scrutinize leaked documents in a way that no mainstream media outlet is capable of. An analogus example is this excellent unweaving of the British government&#8217;s politically motivated additions to an intelligence dossier on Iraq. The dossier was cited by Colin Powell in his address to the United Nations the same month to justify the pending US invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>Our roots are in dissident communities and our focus is on non-western authoritarian regimes. Consequently we believe a politically motivated legal attack on us would be seen as a grave error in western administrations. However, we are prepared, structurally and technically, to deal with all legal attacks. We design the software, and promote its human rights agenda, but the servers are run by anonymous volunteers. Because we have no commercial interest in the software, there is no need to restrict its distribution. In the very unlikely event that we were to face coercion to make the software censorship friendly, there are many others who will continue the work in other jurisdictions.</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We favour, and uphold, ethical behavior in all circumstances. Every person is the ultimate arbiter of justice in their own conscience. Where there is a lack of freedom and injustice is enshrined in law, there is a place for principled civil disobedience. Where the simple act of distributing information may embarrass a regime or expose crime, we recognize a right, indeed a duty, to perform that act. Such whistleblowing normally involves major personal risk. Just like whistleblower protection laws in some jurisdictions, Wikileaks provides means and opportunity to minimize such risks.</p>

<p>We propose that every authoritarian government, every oppressive institution, and even every corrupt corporation, be subject to the pressure, not merely of international diplomacy or freedom of information laws, not even of quadrennial elections, but of something far stronger: the individual consciences of the people within them.</p>

<h3 id="_wikileaks_v_wikipedia">WikiLeaks v. Wikipedia</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks was clearly inspired by Wikipedia and initially encouraged comparisons as a way to generate interest and quickly communicate a global vision for the site. As the original New Scientist article suggested, and as the original website clearly stated, Julian Assange&#8217;s original plan was to create an “uncensorable version of Wikipedia” where users could investigate leaked documents and publish the results with a minimum of editorial overview.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original "About" page (above) mentioned Wikipedia over a dozen times, including a cheeky "for legal reasons" red herring for critics to chase. There was never any legal relationship between WikiLeaks and Wikipedia.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What is your relationship to Wikipedia?</strong> For legal reasons, Wikileaks has no formal relationship to Wikipedia. However both employ the same wiki interface and technology. Both share the same radically democratic philosophy which holds that allowing anyone to be an author or editor leads to a vast and accurate collective intelligence and knowledge. Both place their trust in an informed community of citizens. What Wikipedia is to the encyclopedia, Wikileaks is to leaks. Wikipedia provides a positive example on which Wikileaks is based.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julian Assange soon discovered that productively harnessing and directing the energy of hundreds of eager online users was no easy feat, especially when any hostile actor could open an account and sow disharmony. The forum areas gradually degenerated into confused discussion of side issues and unproductive slanging matches. A year after going live, the core team was still doing all the hard yards. And despite a steady stream of news-worthy output, mainstream media interest was waning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In April 2008, Assange wrote an angry article titled <a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/the_hidden_curse_of_thomas_pai/">The Hidden Curse of Thomas Paine</a>, complaining that major newspapers were not investigating and publishing WikiLeaks material due to insufficient economic incentive. He called them "fresh-faced coquettes with too many suitors [who] long ago stopped cooking their own food and now expect everything to be lovingly presented on a silver platter." He also took a swipe at independent media sites whose "primary motivation is to demonstrate in-group loyalties on the issue du jour".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"What does it mean when only those facts about the world with economic powers behind them can be heard, when the truth lays naked before the world and no one will be the first to speak without payment or subsidy?"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The article included a link to an <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:Analysis_requested">Analysis Requested</a> page on wikileaks.org with dozens of leaked documents still awaiting review and analysis. It&#8217;s no longer possible to post comments on those articles, the latest of which are dated June 2009, because soon afterwards, the WikiLeaks site underwent a major transformation. Public forums had already been closed down but by May 2010 even the comment sections were completely gone. The site now stated simply:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“WikiLeaks is not like Wikipedia.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This gradual shift away from the "wiki" model angered some users who had dedicated time and effort to the cause. Critics claimed that Assange had sold out and WikiLeaks could no longer be trusted. One person angrily <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/05/wikileaks-assange-returns/">complained</a>: “There is no wiki in WikiLeaks.org.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It wasn’t the last time Julian Assange would be frustrated in his efforts to harvest free public input. But the new format also had clear benefits. In 2008, the website was still asserting that “Wikileaks does not pass judgement on the authenticity of documents.” By 2010 it was proudly boasting that “we have yet to make a mistake.” Assange and his editorial team were now taking full ownership of their material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the years, public confusion between WikiLeaks and Wikipedia has persisted, while Wikipedia pages about Assange and WikiLeaks have remained full of errors. It seems to be another case of "economic incentive": WikiLeaks has not had the resources to constantly monitor their Wikipedia pages, while many of their enemies have no lack of funding and are highly skilled at manipulating public opinion.</p>

<p>He must have made some good contacts in the Kenyan capital, because for the next three years WikiLeaks would post numerous explosive leaks about the country. This was the first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On August 30 2007, WikiLeaks published a 2004 UK auditor&#8217;s report detailing how an estimated USD$3 billion in Kenyan state finances were laundered across the world by ex-President Daniel Arap Moi and his close associates. The Kroll Report was commissioned by Moi&#8217;s successor, President Kibaki, after his 2002 election victory on an anti-corruption platform. But the 106 page report, which forensically investigated corrupt transactions and holdings by powerful members of the Kenyan elite, was suppressed for over three years until it was published by WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As WikiLeaks explained, Moi was still a key player in political life and a strong supporter of his successor, President Kibaki, who had become embroiled in his own corruption scandal.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leak which emanated from within high levels of the Kenyan Government is motivated by the desire to demonstrate that President Kibaki has clear-cut evidence of his predecessor&#8217;s corruption and complicity in corruption, and has chosen to suppress the evidence and worse still has gone into a political and economic alliance with the Moi group.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Kenyan Government spokesman <a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/1064-1070892-fuabcw/index.html">responded</a> by saying the “report was based on a lot of hearsay.” Kroll refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of their report. But all politicians named in the leaked document were subsequently defeated at the polls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UK Guardian newspaper&#8217;s 2007 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/31/kenya.topstories3">report of this leak</a> only mentioned their source, WikiLeaks, once, in the 12th paragraph. But in December 2010 the Guardian hosted a live <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2010/dec/03/julian-assange-wikileaks">Q and A</a> with readers where Julian Assange stated:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I always believed that WikiLeaks as a concept would perform a global role and to some degree it was clear that is was doing that as far back as 2007 when it changed the result of the Kenyan general election.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following months, WikiLeaks published more leaks relating to <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Category:Kenya">Kenya</a>, including two cases that were before the High Court at the time:</p>

<p>WikiLeaks released four more bombshells in the latter part of 2007. They caught the attention of global media and intelligence agencies but arguably had an even bigger impact with the online community. It&#8217;s important to put them in historical context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2007 marked the beginning of the end for world leaders who had helped US President George W. Bush start the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. There was growing public resentment about the waste of money and the mis-use of intelligence that had been used to justify these invasions, which had quickly turned into Vietnam-style quagmires. Secret CIA torture sites and the USA&#8217;s Guantanamo Bay prison gulag were also provoking global outrage, with alleged terrorists being tortured and detained indefinitely without trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In February 2007, a junior Senator from Illinois named Barak Obama announced his intention to run for the White House. In June 2007, the deeply unpopular Tony Blair resigned as Britain&#8217;s Prime Minister, with his Labour Party deputy Gordon Brown taking over. In Australia, the eleven year reign of conservative Prime Minister John Howard came to an end, with Labor&#8217;s Kevin Rudd sweeping to a landslide victory in December 2007.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May 2007, after a phone call from John Howard to US Vice President Dick Cheney, Australian prisoner David Hicks was released from Guantanamo Bay, where he had spent five long years. Hicks, who was <a href="https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/david-hicks-charged-%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%98favour%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99-australia-says-former-guantanamo-prosecutor">falsely smeared</a> as one of the "worst of the worst" terrorists, later became a vocal supporter of Julian Assange, speaking at several protest rallies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In July 2007, two Reuters war correspondents in Iraq, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen, were among a dozen or more civilians killed in a US Apache helicopter airstike in Baghdad. Reuters submitted a Freedom of Information <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2010/4/6/massacre_caught_on_tape_us_military">request</a> for the US military video of the attack but never saw the full video till it was released by WikiLeaks in 2010 (see chapter 5). A US military investigation absolved all troops involved of any wrong-doing.</p>

<p>On 9 September 2007 WikiLeaks published the complete equipment register for all units managed by the US Army in Afghanistan. Two months later, WikiLeaks published a similar list of equipment for the US Army in Iraq (see below). These were the first of many leaks relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which would culminate with the 2010 release of the Afghan War Logs and Iraq War Logs.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is currently a critical issue in the US. A majority of Democratic party candidates was elected to both houses of the US Congress in 2006 on an anti-war platform. Under the US Constitution, Congress has the 'power of the purse' to cut off funding for war, but Democrats have not yet sought to use this power. In late April, Congress passed a bill, HR 1591, which did not cut off funding, but instead authorized war funding through 2008 and into 2009. However, the bill was vetoed by President Bush on 1 May because it contained a non-binding timetable for withdrawal of US forces. With pressure building in Washington, further cracks are appearing within the US government itself. Some within the government appear to believe enough is enough. They have leaked several confidential military documents to Wikileaks.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>War always involves a tragic human cost, in lives, emotions, and failure of the human spirit. The leaked documents help us to understand how war money is being spent and the nature of operations in Afghanistan. They provide a completely objective window into the functioning of various US units from PsyOps (psychological operations) to Kabul headquarters. Wikileaks is now releasing the first of these documents, which details each unit&#8217;s computer-registered theatre-supplied arms and support equipment, from missile launchers to paper shredders.</p>

<p>On 4 October 2007 WikiLeaks published a German government report (<a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Stasi-in-bstu.pdf">PDF</a>) on the employment of former members of the Ministry of State Security (East Germany&#8217;s MFS, commonly known as “Stasi“) by the Federal Commissioner for Stasi Files.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analysis showed that the Stasi files commission (BStU) had secretively employed at least 79 former Stasi members, and German government investigations (including investigations of Stasi support for terrorist groups) had been corrupted as a result. The BStU had actively hindered the report investigators and refused them access to files. The agency&#8217;s internal security services were dominated by former Stasi staff, who remained hostile to former East German civil-rights activists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following public outcry over the leaked report, the German Parliament <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi_Records_Agency#cite_ref-21">investigated</a> the BStU and eventually merged it with the national archives.

<p>In the 1960s some academics had expressed "deep dismay" after discovering that their work was secretly funded by covert CIA grants.

<p><a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure" class="bare">https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On November 7 2007 WikiLeaks published the Joint Task Force Guantánamo (JTF-GTMO) standard operating procedures (SOP) for Camp Delta  at the US military&#8217;s Guantánamo Bay prison in Cuba (also known as "Gitmo").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 238-page document was dated 28 March 2003 and signed by Major General Geoffrey D. Miller, who had reportedly introduced harsh interrogation methods, including shackling detainees into stress positions and intimidating them with guard dogs. Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld later transferred Miller to the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq with instructions to "Gitmoize it". The infamous Abu Ghraib torture photos were taken soon after Miller&#8217;s first visit.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the primary document for the operation of Guantánamo bay, including the securing and treatment of detainees&#8230;&#8203; The document exposes, among other matters, systematic methods to prevent prisoners meeting with the Red Cross and the use of extreme psychological stress as torture.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Camp Delta, which replaced the previous Camp X-Ray in 2002, was the prison&#8217;s primary facility, housing 612 units in six detention camps plus Camp Echo, which was used for "pre-commissions". The SOP document included checklists of "comfort items" that could be used to reward detainees (e.g. extra toilet paper) plus detailed instructions on how to psychologically manipulate them. There were also extensive rules for processing new detainees and dealing with hunger strikes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks also published a 209-page document titled <a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Detainee_Operations_in_a_Joint_Environment">Detainee Operations in a Joint Environment</a> which described detainee operations, including the handling of detainees on rendition flights.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had been unsuccessfully trying to obtain these operating procedures, which were unclassified but designated "For Official Use Only", from the US Department of Defense. Jamil Dakwar, an ACLU advocacy director, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080918051302/http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/11/gitmo">said</a> he was struck by "the level of detail for handling all kind of situations." He was also concerned that detainees were classified according to how much access the Red Cross would be allowed to them, including a "No Access" level. The US military had previously promised the Red Cross would be allowed full access to all detainees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Reuters report said that new detainees were "held in near-isolation <strong>for the first two weeks</strong> to foster dependence on interrogators" and "enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process." But WikiLeaks' <a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Guantanamo_document_confirms_psychological_torture">analysis</a> noted that Reuters got it wrong: the "near-isolation" lasted at least four weeks, not two, and could be continued indefinitely.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guantánamo SOP now provides official documentation that, at the time of the Rumsfeld memo and despite its warnings regarding the techniques' potential illegality and physical and psychological dangers, isolation was routinely used by the Defense Department at Guantanamo on all new detainees. The Rumsfeld memo complements the SOP in that it documents the central role of "medical and psychological review," and, thus, medical and psychological personnel in the administration of this technique.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A week after the release of the document by Wikileaks, the Pentagon sent Wikileaks a very polite request: "Good afternoon&#8230;&#8203; Is it possible to have the document removed from your site? Thank you." WikiLeaks did not comply.</p>

But a month later WikiLeaks released an updated <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure_%282004%29">2004 version</a> of the same Camp Delta operating procedures document. Wikileaks journalists and leading Habeas Corpus lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights compared the two documents and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Changes_in_Guantanamo_Bay_SOP_manual_(2003-2004)">published</a> their findings. They said non-compliance with the Geneva Conventions remained official US Policy, there was an extraordinary increase in petty restrictions, and increased hostility towards chaplains and the Red Cross. The "medium security” Camp 4 was exposed as a "media sideshow", rules seemed to have changed for no good reason, and Orwellian terms were being used to cover up harsh realities (e.g. 'hunger strike' becomes VTF - 'voluntary total fasting'). The use of guard dogs and self-harm attempts by prisoners remained at alarming levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas extracted detailed evidence of prisoner abuse found in the SOP releases.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the weeks after these releases, WikiLeaks tracked down and exposed military personnel at Guantánamo Bay <a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks_busts_Gitmo_propaganda_team">tampering with Wikipedia pages</a> about the release. The Guantánamo Bay staff deleted information such as prisoner numbers - e.g. Prisoner No. 766, Canadian-born Omar Khadr - and edited other Wikipedia pages such as Cuban leader Fidel Castro&#8217;s, who they labeled an "admitted transsexual". The New York Times <a href="https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/of-orwell-wikipedia-and-guantanamo-bay/?mtrref=duckduckgo.com&amp;gwh=49F9EB2473CD0EF0E3CDBF63698A7243&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL">compared</a> this activity to the job of rewriting history which was assigned to Winston Smith, the hero of George Orwell&#8217;s fictional novel "1984". A Guantánamo Bay officer denied any of his sailors would do such a thing because "that would be unethical". But he admitted that he could not be sure, because anyone can edit Wikipedia pages anonymously.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These were the first of several WikiLeaks releases about Guantánamo Bay prison: in 2011 they also released Detainee Assessment Briefs (case files) of prisoners; in 2012 they released the rules and procedures covering detainees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In December 2007 WikiLeaks also released the 2004 version of the <a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Bucca_Standard_Operating_Procedure_(2004)">Camp Bucca Standard Operating Procedures</a>. Camp Bucca was the biggest prison in Iraq, holding 20,000 prisoners at the time (later expanded to 30,000) including detainees moved from the torture-plagued Abu Ghraib prison.

<p>On 8 November 2007 WikiLeaks followed up their Afghan War equipment leak (above) with a similar list of US Army equipment in Iraq. The leak revealed the structure of US forces in Iraq, including previously secret units, and at least 2,386 "non-lethal" chemical weapons.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This spectacular 2,000 page US military leak consists of the names, group structure and theatre equipment registers of all units in Iraq with US army equipment. It exposes secretive document exploitation centers, detainee operations, elements of the State Department, Air Force, Navy and Marines units, the Iraqi police and coalition forces from Poland, Denmark, Ukraine, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Armenia, Kazakhstan and El Salvador. The material represents nearly the entire order of battle for US forces in Iraq and is the first public revelation of many of the military units described. Among other matters it shows that the United States may have violated the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks analysis revealed at least $6,601,015,731 worth of US Army managed military equipment in Iraq, with half of all equipment purchases again diverted to dealing with home made mobile phone and radio bombs. Other expenditure included portable mobile chemical and biological laboratories, cryptographic and communications security equipment, 114 drone aircraft, 400 military robots and 446,476 items of body armor. There were also 39 automatic cash counting machines and 1,056 US military safes, because post-invasion Iraq had no functional banking network. This had opened the door to widespread corruption:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the invasion of Iraq in April 2003 until June 2004, the US Army shipped nearly US$12,000,000,000 in cash, weighing 363 tonnes, to Baghdad for disbursement to Iraqi ministries and US contractors. Of this over $9,000,000,000 went missing. The funds were drawn from the Iraq Development Fund, which had been formed from US seized Iraqi assets.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julian Assange also published a separate article titled <a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/US_violates_chemical_weapons_convention">US violates chemical weapons convention</a> which concluded that "extensive provisioning of CS gas by the United State to troops in Iraq appears appears to undermine the Chemical Weapons Convention". Assange detailed the chemical weapons in use and the units where they were deployed, with lengthy tables linking to the inventory database. He even wrote a long section titled "story development notes for journalists". To help readers analyze the data, WikiLeaks also published the <a href="https://wikileaks.org//wiki/Dictionary_of_Military_and_Associated_Terms">US Department of Defense&#8217;s Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as Assange later told <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/no-secrets">Raffi Khatchadourian</a>, the lack of media interest in this huge leak left him fuming:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange hoped that journalists would pore through it, but barely any did. “I am so angry,” he said. “This was such a fucking fantastic leak: the Army’s force structure of Afghanistan and Iraq, down to the last chair, and nothing.”</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two months later, however, the New York Times published a widely discussed story by James Risen titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/world/middleeast/10blackwater.html?ref=world">2005 Use of Gas by Blackwater leaves questions</a>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2002 the Bermuda police investigated allegations of corruption at the Bermuda Housing Corporation (BHC) following the loss of $8 million. In 2006, comments from the Attorney General suggested a total of $792 million had gone missing from various projects due to government "leakage". In May 2007, media reports describe a huge police investigation with a dossier comprising thousands of pages. A senior officer described it as “an investigation of what undoubtedly remains the largest and most serious crimes of conspiracy, drug trafficking, and money laundering ever conducted in the Bermuda Police Service."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The head of police initially said the huge police dossier was "missing" but it was later described as "stolen". The British island nation&#8217;s leader was apparently implicated but never questioned by police. In early June 2007 two of Bermuda&#8217;s local news agencies reported that a source had sent them a letter containing important facts about the police dossier. Bermuda&#8217;s Attorney General immediately slapped a gag order on further reporting. A local political commentator posted the letter (not the full police dossier) online but <a href="http://www.politics.bm/archives/2007/06/13_001364.html">removed</a> it after being placed under injuction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 3 October 2007 WikiLeaks published the letter provided to the media (<a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Son-of-the-soil.pdf">PDF</a>) along with an additional note from the source, who called himself "Son of the soil":</p>

<p>The Police dossier did not exonerate the Premier, as you will see on review of the attached document.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Local press appealed the gag order all the way to London&#8217;s Privy Council, which is Bermuda&#8217;s highest court of appeal.

<p>The 2004 attack on the Iraqi town of Fallujah was a decisive moment in the Iraq War, revealing how media coverage played a decisive role in the conflict. Fallujah was first bombed by US forces in April 2003, and there were repeated incidents of US troops opening fire on protestors in the following weeks. A year later US Marines were still fighting running battles with insurgents in the streets and "shooting their way out of trouble". On 31 March 2004, four Blackwater private military contractors were killed and their burned bodies were filmed hanging from a bridge. Global media coverage prompted calls from Washington for a rapid response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Local US Marines planned raids to target those responsible but Joint Task Force commanders ordered a full-scale siege instead. Despite overwhelming military superiority, US forces were pressured into an embarrassing cease-fire after just five days of combat operations, followed by a full withdrawal on 1 May 2004. A detailed US Army report into the fiasco was ordered. It was classified "SECRET/NOFORN" so US allies in Iraq could not read it.</p>

<p>In November 2004 US forces re-siezed town of Fallujah in an attack that has been described as a massacre, with reports of numerous war crimes including use of chemical weapons, cluster bombs and attacks on the local hospital.

Major General John Kelly, the new commander of US forces in western Iraq, visited the city to investigate. A month later, WikiLeaks released his <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Classified_memo_from_US_Maj._Gen._Kelly_confirms_Fallujah_Gulag">classified memo</a>: it revealed horrific conditions: "unbelievable over crowding, total lack of anything approaching even minimal levels of hygiene for human beings, no food, little water, no ventilation."</p>
