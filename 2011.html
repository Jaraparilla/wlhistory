<p>7th Dec 2010
Andrew Brown&#8217;s Guardian blog <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-israel-shamir-russia-scandinavia" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-israel-shamir-russia-scandinavia</a> begins: "WikiLeaks&#8217;s spokesperson and conduit in Russia has been exposed in the Swedish media as an anti-semite and Holocaust denier&#8230;&#8203;" The Swedish media source he cites is Expressen, which is part of a right-wing media group owned by the Jewish Bonnier family.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>31st Jan 2011
A Guardian extract <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/31/wikileaks-holocaust-denier-handled-moscow-cables?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/31/wikileaks-holocaust-denier-handled-moscow-cables?INTCMP=SRCH</a> from the Leigh/Harding book is titled: "Holocaust denier in charge of handling Moscow cables". The extract quotes “one staffer” and “one insider” - both of whom appear to be James Ball. It also describes “internal WikiLeaks documents, seen by the Guardian” without revealing Ball as the source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>5th Feb 2011
Writing in The Guardian, self-styled Web guru Evgeny Mozorov, pre-emptively declares Assange finished <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/feb/07/age-wikileaks-style-vigilante-geek-over?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/feb/07/age-wikileaks-style-vigilante-geek-over?INTCMP=SRCH</a> . He throws in an obligatory Shamir reference, albeit fairly recognising him as “a stranger” to WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>16th Feb 2011
Assange contacts <a href="http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/Ian%20Hislop,%20Private%20Eye,%20No.%201283.pdf" class="bare">http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/Ian%20Hislop,%20Private%20Eye,%20No.%201283.pdf</a> Private Eye magazine to complain about an article linking him with Shamir, including leaked emails suggesting Assange does not find Shamir’s writing anti-Semitic. Liberal Conspiracy, "the UK&#8217;s most popular left-of-centre politics blog", gives a Hat Tip to James Ball for the story <a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/03/01/assange-goes-off-deep-end-blaming-jews-and-guardian-in-private-eye/" class="bare">http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/03/01/assange-goes-off-deep-end-blaming-jews-and-guardian-in-private-eye/</a> . Hmn, I wonder where Private Eye got those leaked emails?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>24th Feb 2011
David Leigh tries to put the boot into Assange. In an article titled "It&#8217;s Julian Assange&#8217;s own 'tizzy' that bamboozles", <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/24/julian-assange-tizzy-important-work?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/24/julian-assange-tizzy-important-work?INTCMP=SRCH</a> he ridicules Assange&#8217;s complaints, casts aspersions on his lawyers, and then (bizarrrely) lectures him about keeping his private life out of the media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1st March 2011
A week after a judge rules that Assange should be extradited to Sweden, Private Eye&#8217;s Ian Hislop opens fire in The Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/mar/01/julian-assange-jewish-conspiracy-comments" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/mar/01/julian-assange-jewish-conspiracy-comments</a> . Assange responds: "Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and in word."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3rd March 2011
John Kampfner, CEO of Index on Censorship, cites Israel Shamir as his central reason for not supporting WikiLeaks. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/03/julian-assange-big-picture?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/03/julian-assange-big-picture?INTCMP=SRCH</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>9th April 2011
Esther Addley writes in The Guardian: "Douglas Murray, director of the centre for social cohesion, challenged Assange over the website&#8217;s sources of funding, its staffing and connections with the Holocaust denier Israel Shamir, who has worked with the site."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2nd Sept 2011
A Guardian editorial <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/02/leader-wikileaks-unredacted-release?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/02/leader-wikileaks-unredacted-release?INTCMP=SRCH</a> blames Assange for releasing the unredacted Cablegate files: "[WikiLeaks] has dwindled to being the vehicle of one flawed individual&#8230;&#8203; occasionally brilliant, but increasingly volatile and erratic." There is no mention of David Leigh&#8217;s password gaffe, nor of disgruntled ex-WikiLeaks staffer Daniel Domscheit-Berg, whose comments to German media triggered the public exposure of the files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2nd Sept 2011
Former WikiLeaks insider James Ball writes: Why I Had To Leave WikiLeaks <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/02/why-i-had-to-leave-wikileaks" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/02/why-i-had-to-leave-wikileaks</a> . In this article, Ball cites Shamir as his reason for leaving WikiLeaks, although he also says "the last straw" was Assange&#8217;s decision to publish the full, unredacted CableGate file (never mind it was his new editors at The Guardian who published the password). Ball also claims that he was worried that after the most important cables had been redacted, "a large volume of cables would remain, of little interest to any media organisation." And yet, when the unredacted cables were released, Ball took no further interest in them. He nonchalantly Tweeted that the media had “had their turn” with the cables, and it was the public&#8217;s turn now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>18th Sept 2011
Nick Cohen goes to town with a disgusting smear piece in The Guardian: "The treachery of Julian Assange" <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/18/julian-assange-wikileaks-nick-cohen?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/18/julian-assange-wikileaks-nick-cohen?INTCMP=SRCH</a> . Cohen claims that the Shamir allegations render anything Assange ever says or does meaningless: "One can say with certainty, however, that Assange&#8217;s involvement with Shamir is enough to discredit his claim that he published the documents in full because my colleagues on the Guardian inadvertently revealed a link to a site he was meant to have taken down."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>26th Sept 2011
Ignoring basic media principles, David Leigh reviews the “unauthorised autobiography” of Assange: "It&#8217;s a shame Assange couldn&#8217;t get on with the Guardian&#8230;&#8203; Assange shows, regrettably, that he is living in a fantasy world." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/26/julian-assange-unauthorised-autobiography-review?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/26/julian-assange-unauthorised-autobiography-review?INTCMP=SRCH</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2nd Oct 2011
Karin Olsson, Culture Editor at Sweden&#8217;s Expressen, is invited by a Guardian editor to write another substance-free smear piece: "Julian Assange: from hero to zero" <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/02/assange-hero-zero-swedes-pitiable?INTCMP=SRCH" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/02/assange-hero-zero-swedes-pitiable?INTCMP=SRCH</a> . She calls Assange “a paranoid chauvinist pig [who] cuts an increasingly pitiable figure”. As with the Nick Cohen article, this smear is widely reprinted in newspapers around the world, including Australia&#8217;s Fairfax media. Once again, Assange&#8217;s over-hyped association with Shamir is the central pillar of the attack. And as usual with these Guardian smear pieces, readers' comments are overwhelmingly disgusted at the author.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8th Nov 2011
James Ball wades back into the fray, ostensibly in protection of women&#8217;s rights: Israel Shamir and Julian Assange&#8217;s cult of machismo. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/08/israel-shamir-julian-assange-cult-machismo?CMP=twt_gu" class="bare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/08/israel-shamir-julian-assange-cult-machismo?CMP=twt_gu</a>  While slammming both men as misogynists, Ball repeats tired claims <a href="http://jaraparilla.blogspot.com/2011/10/where-now-wikileaks.html" class="bare">http://jaraparilla.blogspot.com/2011/10/where-now-wikileaks.html</a> that Shamir gave unredacted US cables to the President of Belarus. Readers comments – including mine – are again overwhelmingly hostile to the author.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the reason Manning is now in military detention, awaiting court martial, perhaps ultimately lies in a smaller action still, an error thousands of email users make daily: choosing "cc" rather than "bcc"&#8230;&#8203;. Julian Assange boasts of "systems" in place to ensure he can have no idea as to the identity of a source. These – as these logs corroborate – are non-existent: Manning communicated directly with Assange&#8230;&#8203; It is difficult to see who is protected by an arm&#8217;s-length relationship with regular sources, other than WikiLeaks itself.</p>

<p>17/12/10, 4pm - Andrew Brown publishes blog with all source links still in Swedish language. Obviously a rush job as they didn&#8217;t even bother to translate these sources. Brown even apologises for this at the end of the article. As well as smearing Israel Shamir it also seeks to smear his son, Johann Walstrom - Witness E in the Swedish case and a favourable witness for Assange - by association with his father.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>17/12/10, 7pm - The Guardian writes 3 articles on the Belarus cables and 3 on the Cuba cables. It then uploads all its redacted Belarus and Cuba cables to Wikileaks. Some are very heavily - and apparently unnecessarily - redacted. Bear in mind that Israel Shamir was the first journalist to write about the Guardian "cable cooking".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>17/12/10, 9pm - Nick Davies publishes the notorious "10 Days in Sweden" hit piece, which shamelessly distorted the leaked police protocol, kicking off the personal smear attacks against Assange in the English-speaking media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Andrew Brown is the religious ("belief") editor at the Comment Is Free (CIF) section of Guardian. He lived in Sweden previously and still writes about it regularly. He invited Karin Olsson to write the Assange smear, as she admits here.</p>

<p>30 November 2011: Following Channel 4&#8217;s "WikiLeaks: Secrets and Lies" smear-filled TV documentary, wikileaks.org published full details of the Guardian&#8217;s involvement and producer&#8217;s correspondence: <a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/Guardian-s-WikiLeaks-Secrets-and.html" class="bare">http://www.wikileaks.org/Guardian-s-WikiLeaks-Secrets-and.html</a></p>

<p>A response from Shamir to James Ball: "A Portrait of the Petty Cheat as a Young Man"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Cheats and thieves have to prove their moral superiority over their victims in order to justify their crimes. This is the case with a petty cheat and thief called James Ball. This young man was a hired hand in the Wikileaks; he was offered a bribe of a job by the Guardian and he gratefully accepted it, betraying Julian Assange&#8217;s trust and stealing all he could put his sweaty hands on. Since then, he is obsessed with demeaning and debunking Assange: only moral disgrace of the Australian will reduce the burden of the traitor&#8217;s guilt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"One of his favourite routes is attacking Assange for associating with me, and today he did it again in the Guardian, responding to my recent piece Unmanning the Man. His arguments are repetitious, baseless and lame: I am called "anti-Semite", "H-denier" and "the man who gave the State Department secrets to Lukashenko" time and again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Shamir asked for access to all cable material concerning "the Jews", a request which was refused", says Ball. Oh no, James! That was before your switching sides, and you dutifully obliged. You did it even twice: <strong>just before my departure you came to me on your own initiative and kindly handed me "a better file on Jews", twice as big as the previous one</strong>. Apparently lying and cheating is your second nature by now."</p>

<p>The year 2011 began with Chelsea Manning in de facto solitary confinement at the US Marine Corps' Quantico Brig in Virginia, while Julian Assange was under house arrest at Ellingham Hall, the ten-bedroom country mansion of a friend and supporter, Vaughan Smith, in Norfolk, England.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smith, a former Army officer and war correspondent, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/julian-assanges-guardian-angel-frontline-club-founder-vaughan-smith">bristled</a> at media hostility towards Assange.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have seen a human side of him that hasn’t been represented in the press. He is incredibly popular with my children, who see him as sort of an uncle figure. He’s somebody who will listen to you, and he’s somebody who will give you time and give you attention and help you&#8230;&#8203; He’s damn good company.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smith also ridiculed media claims that the much-vaunted "age of WikiLeaks" was already over.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think there are lots of bullies here. I think the British press have been bullying. I think the American government have been bullies. But it’s wider than that&#8230;&#8203; Julian is presented as some sort of slightly nutty proponent of radical transparency. Actually, the truth is, he isn’t anything of the sort.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think it would be foolish to determine WikiLeaks is over. It’s far too premature for that&#8230;&#8203; I don’t think we’ve seen the end of Assange.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s bail conditions included wearing an electronic ankle tag, reporting daily in person to the local police station, and observing a curfew between 10 pm and 8 am. Assange was frequently photographed by the media in the company of <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Profile-Sarah-Harrison.html">Sarah Harrison</a>, who has modestly <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/sarah-harrison-the-woman-behind-whistblowers-edward-snowden-and-julian-assange-a3342546.html">described herself</a> as "just a blonde girl" with "the most boring name ever”. Harrison had joined WikiLeaks to help with the Afghan War Diaries after previously working as an investigative researcher for The Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Centre for Investigative Journalism. Rumours of a romantic relationship were quick to spread.</p>

<h3 id="_january">January</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 6 January 2011 Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/02/the-guardian-201102?currentPage=all%3Cbr%20/%3E">published</a> a lengthy but unreliable account of how WikiLeaks had worked with various media organisations in the previous year. "The Man Who Spilled The Secrets" article included a potted history of the Guardian and treated Guardian journalists, particularly editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, with an awed reverence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first week of January 2011 also saw Bianca Jagger publish a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-julian-assange-trial_b_805299">rebuttal</a> of Nick Davies' <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_1506_b_802680">rebuttal</a> of her <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trial-by-newspaper_b_800847">rebuttal</a> of his original Guardian article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden">Ten Days In Sweden</a>, which had provided extensive details from the Swedish police file on the Assange case. Davies, who acknowledged having fallen out with Assange months earlier, had rejected Jagger&#8217;s claims that his one-sided article, peppered with lurid sexual details, amounted to "trial by newspapers".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Davies said the Swedish police file, which would normally have remained secret to guarantee a fair trail for all parties concerned, just "happened to make its way quite legitimately into the hands of somebody I have come across in the past". He refused to identify his source, who probably committed a crime by leaking the file, and finally washed his hands of responsibility for the article that bore his name:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reality is that I didn’t write the story which the Guardian published. The copy which I filed was completely re-written in the Guardian office, a commonplace event in a newsroom.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jagger dismissed Davies' ludicrous claim that he was defending his source just like WikiLeaks defended theirs, noting "there is a profound difference between exposing the deeds of powerful governments, corporations and the rich and throwing mud at those who released the information". She also made an important point which would have profound repercussions for years to come:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange cannot defend himself at this point; all he can do is refute these allegations in the broadest terms. Davies knows that Assange’s lawyers will insist that he does not publicly engage in a rebuttal of the details in these allegations himself, when he is facing extradition and possible criminal charges. He is thoroughly disadvantaged by what Davies has done.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange would never get his "day in court" to publicly refute the Swedish allegations. He would have to wait nearly seven more years before Swedish prosecutors even came to question him in London, as they routinely did in similar cases. And he would eventually learn that UK Crown Prosecutors had secretly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/11/sweden-tried-to-drop-assange-extradition-in-2013-cps-emails-show">warned</a> their Swedish counterparts not to "get cold feet" and close the case (and then deleted their emails). Meanwhile, hostile media voices were free to say whatever they liked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 8 January 2011, while supporters of Assange and WikiLeaks organised more <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/868">global protests</a>, WikiLeaks <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikileaks/status/23591796542013441">launched</a> a new defense fund for Julian Assange, tweeting: "let us see Paypal try to close this one down too!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the same day, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/23604032362778625?s=20">revealed</a> that the US Department of Justice had issued Twitter with a court order, dated 14 December 2010 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110108131805/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/07/twitter/subpoena.pdf">PDF</a>), for "all records" and "correspondence" relating to accounts "registered to or associated with WikiLeaks". These included Julian Assange and Bradley Manning, along with Iceland MP Birgitta Jónsdóttir, Tor developer Jacob Appelbaum, and Dutch hacker Rop Gonggrijp, who had helped work on the Collateral Murder video.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Twitter advised affected users that they had ten days to oppose the request for information about their accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/world/09wiki.html">reported</a> that this was "the first public evidence" of the criminal investigation ordered a month earlier by Obama&#8217;s Attorney General Eric Holder, and said that the investigation would be "fraught with legal and political difficulties". Gonggrijp <a href="https://rop.gonggri.jp/?p=448">noted</a> that the affected users only found out about the order "because Twitter did the right thing and successfully fought for a second court order so they were able to tell us". Citing concerns for his young family, Gonggrijp later terminated his public support for WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DoJ court order caused <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/863">outrage</a> on Twitter, with @wikileaks warning that all 637,000 of their followers were now being targeted by the US government "under section 2.B" of the order. Enraged followers threatened a class action lawsuit against the US government. Others were intimidated into unfollowing @wikileaks, but within a week the account had a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikileaks/status/25454900083171328">net gain</a> of 12,000 followers (hello again, Streisand Effect). Icelandic politicians voiced concerns that an MP colleague was being targeted and Foreign Minister Oessur Skarphedinsson <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14758284,00.html">told German media</a> it was not acceptable that US authorities had demanded such information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After some deliberation, Jacob Applebaum decided to push ahead with his planned return to the USA on 10 January, but organised for representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to meet him at the airport. He then <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/918">posted</a> a long series of tweets about the constant harrassment he received when traveling through US airports.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 11 January 2011 Julian Assange&#8217;s routine case management hearing at Belmarsh Magistrates Court was swamped with media and supporters. The Guardian&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2011/jan/11/wikileaks-latest-developments">live-blog</a> of the event included continuing global fallout from the US cable publications and highlights from a 35-page <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/902">skeleton outline</a> of court arguments from Assange&#8217;s lawyers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were valid security concerns around Assange&#8217;s court appearance, especially following the recent shooting of a US politician. WikiLeaks published a <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/82g3kb">statement</a> condemning violent threats:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks staff and contributors have also been the target of unprecedented violent rhetoric by US prominent media personalities, including Sarah Palin, who urged the US administration to “Hunt down the WikiLeaks chief like the Taliban”. Prominent US politician Mike Huckabee called for the execution of WikiLeaks spokesman Julian Assange on his Fox News program last November, and Fox News commentator Bob Beckel, referring to Assange, publicly called for people to "illegally shoot the son of a bitch." US radio personality Rush Limbaugh has called for pressure to "Give [Fox News President Roger] Ailes the order and [then] there is no Assange, I&#8217;ll guarantee you, and there will be no fingerprints on it.", while the Washington Times columnist Jeffery T. Kuhner titled his column “Assassinate Assange” captioned with a picture Julian Assange overlayed with a gun site, blood spatters, and “WANTED DEAD or ALIVE” with the alive crossed out.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John Hawkins of Townhall.com has stated "If Julian Assange is shot in the head tomorrow or if his car is blown up when he turns the key, what message do you think that would send about releasing sensitive American data?"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Christian Whiton in a Fox News opinion piece called for violence against WikiLeaks publishers and editors, saying the US should "designate WikiLeaks and its officers as enemy combatants, paving the way for non-judicial actions against them."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks spokesman Julian Assange said: "No organisation anywhere in the world is a more devoted advocate of free speech than Wikileaks but when senior politicians and attention seeking media commentators call for specific individuals or groups of people to be killed they should be charged with incitement&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to murder. Those who call for an act of murder deserve as significant share of the guilt as those raising a gun to pull the trigger."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The web addresss julianassangemustdie.com, which was traced to a rightwing US blogger, was deleted soon afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the economic threats from US officials continued. On 12 January 2011 WikiLeaks <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/WIKILEAKS-PRESS-RELEASE.html">responded</a> to Rep. Peter T. King&#8217;s calls for a US embargo of WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks today condemned calls from the chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security to "strangle the viability" of WikiLeaks by placing the publisher and its editor-in-chief, Julian Assange, on a US "enemies list" normally reserved for terrorists and dictators.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>King specifically wanted to target Knopf, a New York publisher who had recently agreed to pay Assange for an autobiography. Assange said the book royalties would "keep Wikileaks afloat". An article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/blacklisting-wikileaks/69535/">the Atlantic</a> ridiculed the madness of such a McCarthyist blacklist: "you could conceivably break the law merely by buying his book, or contributing to a WikiLeaks defense fund".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks was under massive pressure but clearly not going down without a fight. In a 12 January <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/01/china-wikileaks-assange">interview</a> with John Pilger, Assange mentioned the existence of "insurance files":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"WikiLeaks is now mirrored on more than 2,000 websites&#8230;&#8203; If something happens to me or to WikiLeaks, ‘insurance’ files will be released&#8230;&#8203;. There are 504 US embassy cables on one broadcasting organisation and there are cables on Murdoch and News Corp.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Was it a bluff? In years to come, WikiLeaks would repeatedly post such encrypted "insurance files" online. This lead to a lot of wild speculation about the contents, and much of that speculation eventually solidified into misguided belief. Uninformed critics still angrily disclaim how WikiLeaks "promised" to post something but never did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>15 January 2011 saw more <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/947">global protests</a>. The rally in Sydney, Australia <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/939">drew</a> around a thousand supporters. This followed another huge Sydney protest on 14 December 2010, with another one planned for 6 February 2011. WikiLeaks supporters around the world were energised, outraged, and working together to support their heroes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such protests always featured prominent support for Chelsea Manning, who had now been jailed at the Quantico brig under torturous conditions for over five months. On 24 January, two Manning supporters (including regular visitor David House) were <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1063">turned away</a> from the facility after they attempted to deliver a petition of support with 42,000 signatures. On the following day, NBC reported that US military officials had placed Manning on suicide watch.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The official said that after Manning had allegedly failed to follow orders from his Marine guards, [Brig Commander James] Averhart declared Manning a "suicide risk." Manning was then placed on suicide watch, which meant he was confined to his cell, stripped of most of his clothing and deprived of his reading glasses — anything that Manning could use to harm himself.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning later claimed that the guards had created a scene by issuing conflicting demands such as "turn left, don&#8217;t turn left". An investigation found that the Brig Commander had acted unlawfully, and he was replaced. Manning was removed from suicide watch on January 21 but remained on POI (Prevention Of Injury) status, despite repeated calls from Army health professionals for this to be lifted. Manning&#8217;s lawyers filed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233021/http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/01/article-138-complaint.html">complaint</a> explaining exactly what this POI status entailed:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like suicide risk, he is held in solitary confinement. For 23 hours per day, he will sit in his cell. The guards will check on him every five minutes by asking him if he is okay. PFC Manning will be required to respond in some affirmative manner. At night, if the guards cannot see him clearly, because he has a blanket over his head or is curled up towards the wall, they will wake him in order to ensure that he is okay. He will receive each of his meals in his cell. He will not be allowed to have a pillow or sheets. He will not be allowed to have any personal items in his cell. He will only be allowed to have one book or one magazine at any given time to read. The book or magazine will be taken away from him at the end of the day before he goes to sleep. He will be prevented from exercising in his cell. If he attempts to do push-ups, sit-ups, or any other form of exercise he will be forced to stop. He will receive one hour of exercise outside of his cell daily. The guards will take him to an empty room and allow him to walk. He will usually just walk in figure eights around the room until his hour is complete. When he goes to sleep, he will be required to strip down to his underwear and surrender his clothing to the guards.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 24 January 2011 Amnesty International <a href="https://blog.amnestyusa.org/waronterror/inhumane-treatment-of-wikileaks-soldier-bradley-manning/">issued a call</a> for the USA to "alleviate the harsh pre-trial detention conditions of Bradley Manning." They <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/qa-wikileaks-and-freedom-of-expression/">ignored</a> pleas to show similar support for Julian Assange.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are unaware of any legal action having yet been taken against Julian Assange for releasing the documents. As such, Amnesty International is not in a position to comment on any possible case against him specifically, as there are no charges to comment on.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amnesty also refused to comment on the Swedish allegations, arguing only that "due process should be followed". Their strange lack of interest in the Assange case was to endure many years, with only very occasional and limited mentions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The US government may not yet have charged Assange, but they already had a sealed indictment waiting for him, which meant they could file a charge whenever they chose to unseal the indictment. A 26 January 2011 email from Fred Burton, a Vice President at private intelligence firm Stratfor, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1352579_fw-ct-assange-manning-link-not-key-to-wikileaks-case-.html">stated</a>:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fred Burton was Stratfor&#8217;s Vice-President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security, and a former Deputy Chief of the Department of State&#8217;s counterterrorism division for the Diplomatic Security Service. Stratfor&#8217;s business model relies on close communication with US intelligence agencies, and many Stratfor staff are former CIA agents. Burton&#8217;s email was not uninformed gossip - Assange’s own lawyers had already warned of a possible indictment - but it remained secret until February 2012, when WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Stratfor-Emails-US-Has-Issued.html">released</a> the <a href="http://wikileaks.org/the-gifiles.html">Global Intelligence files</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite such evidence of a US indictment, media commentators and senior government officials in Britain, Australia, and Sweden - many of whom must have known about the sealed indictment - continued to pretend that Assange&#8217;s fears of extradition to the USA were entirely baseless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>In November 2013 the Washington Post went even further, falsely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131121011138/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/assange-not-under-sealed-indictment-us-officials-say/2013/11/18/8a3cb2da-506c-11e3-a7f0-b790929232e1_story.html">reporting</a> that Assange was "not under sealed indictment" based on comments from anonymous US officials.</p>

<p>Also on 26 January 2011, the New York Times' executive editor Bill Keller published a <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1126">ridiculously long</a> article about his dealings with WikiLeaks during the previous year. Keller was intent on establishing his own narrative of events, thus insulating his newspaper from allegations of irresponsible reporting, but he also provided qualified support for Assange and WikiLeaks in the face of US government threats:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But while I do not regard Assange as a partner, and I would hesitate to describe what WikiLeaks does as journalism, it is chilling to contemplate the possible government prosecution of WikiLeaks for making secrets public, let alone the passage of new laws to punish the dissemination of classified information, as some have advocated. Taking legal recourse against a government official who violates his trust by divulging secrets he is sworn to protect is one thing. But criminalizing the publication of such secrets by someone who has no official obligation seems to me to run up against the First Amendment and the best traditions of this country.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Five days later, 60 Minutes aired a lengthy <a href="http://is.gd/7Ll9ZM">interview</a> with Assange were he claimed "our founding values are those of the U.S. revolution".</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange insisted that WikiLeaks&#8217;s 2010 releases would in fact be "encouragement to every other publisher to publish fearlessly."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the world was in turmoil. Tunisia&#8217;s president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/14/tunisian-president-flees-country-protests">fled his country</a> in mid-January 2011 - despite winning 89% of the vote two years earlier - and became the first dictator to fall in what became known as the Arab Spring. The widespread protests were at least partly triggered by WikiLeaks' Cablegate publications, which provided hard proof of endemic corruption across the Middle East.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final days of January saw huge protests in Egypt, with US-backed dictator Hosni Mubarak repeatedly shutting down Internet access to stem the flow of information. On 29 January activists began <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikileaks/status/31046777343836160">faxing</a> WikiLeaks cables into Egypt to bypass the Internet blockade. Mubarak resigned less than two weeks later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Critics accused Assange of trying to take full credit for these revolutions, although he did no such thing. On 30 January 2011 @wikileaks <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/31448923629420544?s=20">tweeted</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, we may have helped Tunisia, Egypt. But let us not forget the elephant in the room: Al Jazeera + sat dishes</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Arab Spring also saw many online activists joining the #Anonymous global collective to bring down government websites with massive Denial of Service (DDos) attacks. Western analysts could hardly complain when such activists helped bring down authoritarian governments in the Middle East, but it was a different story for those who had targetted US and British websites in the previous year. On 28 January the FBI <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/warrants_012711">announced</a> that it had executed over forty search warrants in response to DDoS attacks, while five people were <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1104">arrested</a> in the United Kingdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anons reacted to these arrests by publishing an <a href="https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2011/01/472905.html">open letter</a> to the UK government, ridiculing the harsh penalties (maximum 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to £5000) for a crime that temporarily brought down websites but left no permament damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that thousands of people from all over the world felt the need to participate in these attacks on organisations targeting Wikileaks and treating it as a public threat, rather than a common good, should be something that sets you thinking.

<h3 id="_february">February</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the first day of February 2011 Guardian editor David Leigh and Guardian journalist Luke Harding published a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/WikiLeaks-Inside-Julian-Assanges-Secrecy/dp/0852652399">WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange’s War on Secrecy</a>. The book was rushed into print to maximise profits from the recent leaks, but it was not the first published WikiLeaks book. A book in German by DDB was published in January 2011, while <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1949679">The Age of WikiLeaks</a> was published by veteran US journalist Greg Mitchell on 29 January 2011.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the book by Leigh and Harding, with an introduction by Guardian Editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, had the most impact, not only because Hollywood later bought the movie rights, but because it contained a chapter with the subheading:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"ACollectionOfDiplomaticHistorySince_1966_ToThe_PresentDay#".</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This, as the book revealed, was the secret password to a huge encypted file which contained all the Cablegate data. Assange had entrusted the password to Leigh in 2010 so that the Guardian editor could browse the data and cherry-pick the stories the Guardian wanted to cover.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What Leigh did not know was that a copy of the full Cablegate archive still existed "in the wild" on the Internet. Now that Leigh had published the password, anyone who knew the location of the file could access the full unredacted contents. Fortunately, only a few people knew the location. Unfortunately, one of those people was Daniel Domscheit-Berg.</p>

Others quickly pointed out the leaked document was unsigned. Yes, it was my copy of the agreement that was published. The leak was hardly premeditated though – it emerged through the refusal of transparency campaigner Heather Brooke to believe I was not joking when discussing the terms of the WikiLeaks contract. Inadvertently, I sent her a photograph of a portion of the document publicly rather than privately, over Twitter. Needless to say, this provoked a lot of interest, and one thing then led to another.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was January this year, and around 10 WikiLeaks staff and volunteers were working from Norfolk, where Julian Assange is confined thanks to his legal travails. Julian arrived with a copy of this document for everyone in the room, and asked all to sign it there and then, to demonstrate to all present they were trustworthy and decent. Unlike everyone else present – who were largely young activists with little or no professional training – I read the document first. In addition to the aforementioned concerns, the document was backdated – in my case by seven months. I had given dozens of print and TV interviews, at Julian&#8217;s instruction, often covering small behind-the-scenes snippets. Could this document now be used retrospectively to mount a legal challenge should Julian ever so wish? It could. I refused to sign, and listed several reasons why. At this point, more than one person in the room asked for their copy of the agreement back. This was refused. Julian then proceeded to spend two hours – shouting – explaining why I must sign the document, or else risk the lives and wellbeing of everyone in the room, and never be trusted again. Eventually, he departed. The rest of the day, and long into the night, was spent with other WikiLeakers begging, reasoning, or cajoling me into signing the document. I later learned Julian had specifically requested they use every possible effort to "apply psychological pressure" until I signed. Next morning the conversation resumed in private. In far more measured terms than the previous day, Julian acknowledged no one but him was in any personal danger. He said as I had already given notice I&#8217;d be leaving the organisation, surely I could understand that WikiLeaks would need "something to use against you" should I prove unreliable. At one point, getting nowhere, he even referred to the need to protect his intellectual rights in case it damage the profitability of his book.

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A person in close contact with other WikiLeaks activists around Europe, who asked for anonymity when discussing a sensitive topic, says that man of them were privately concerned that Assange has continued to spread allegations of dirty tricks and hint at conspiracies against him without justification. Insiders say that some people affiliated with the website are already brainstorming whether there might be some way to persuade their front man to step aside, or failing that, even to oust him.</p>

<p>Assange thought DDB was the culprit and confronted him. Wired magazine <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/wikileaks-revolt/">published "purported" excerpts</a> from the conversation. Wired said "At least half a dozen WikiLeaks staffers have tendered their resignations in recent weeks". TRUE?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a 2009 interview with Computerworld magazine, Assange claimed to be in possession of "5GB from Bank of America". In 2010, he told Forbes magazine that WikiLeaks was planning another "megaleak" early in 2011, from the private sector, involving "a big U.S. bank" and revealing an "ecosystem of corruption". Bank of America&#8217;s stock price decreased by 3%, apparently as a result of this announcement.[284][285] Assange commented on the possible effect of the release that "it could take down a bank or two".[286][287] In August 2011, Reuters reported that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had destroyed around 3,000 submissions related to Bank of America (most of them "random junk"), out of concern over Wikileaks' inadequate protection of sources.[288] The Wikileaks Twitter account (believed to be controlled by Assange) stated "five gigabytes from the Bank of America" had been deleted, but Domscheit-Berg stated that he had only destroyed material received after Assange&#8217;s Computerworld interview, and raised the possibility that Assange had lost access to the material because of technical deficiencies in Wikileaks' submission system</p>

<p>Müller-Maguhn was criticized for his role in the CCC board&#8217;s controversial decision to expel former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, which was often attributed to Müller-Maguhn&#8217;s close relation to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and an ongoing conflict between Assange and Domscheit-Berg.[4] At an extraordinary general meeting in February 2012, this decision was reverted, while Müller-Maguhn was not reelected to the board.[1]</p>

<p>WikiLeaks Statement on Daniel Domscheit-Berg and OpenLeaks</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sat Aug 20 23:41:31 2011 GMT</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Five days short of a year ago, on 25 August 2010, WikiLeaks suspended former employee "Daniel Domscheit-Berg". Over the last 11 months, we have tried to negotiate the return of various materials taken by Mr. Domscheit-Berg, including internal communications and over 3000 unpublished, private whistleblower communications to WikiLeaks. Mr. Domscheit-Berg has repeatedly attempted to blackmail WikiLeaks by threatening to make available, to forces that oppose WikiLeaks, these private communications and to which Mr. Domscheit-Berg is not a party. He has stated he will commit this action, should WikiLeaks move to charge him with sabotage or theft. Mr. Domscheit-Berg has refused to return the various materials he has stolen, saying he needs them, solely, to carry out this threat. Mr. Domscheit-Berg has already, secretly, and with malicious intent, disclosed portions of the private communications content to other parties, to the harm of WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The negotiations have now been terminated by the mediator, Andy Müller-Maguhn, who has stated that he doubts Mr. Domscheit-Berg&#8217;s integrity and claimed willingness to return the material and that under those circumstances Müller-Maguhn cannot meaningfully continue to mediate. In response, Mr. Domscheit-Berg has stated that he has, or is about to, destroy thousands of unpublished whistleblowers disclosures sent to WikiLeaks. The material is irreplaceable and includes substantial information on many issues of public importance, human rights abuses, mass telecommunications interception, banking and the planning of dozens of neo-nazi groups. Our sources have in some cases risked their lives or freedom attempting to convey these disclosures to WikiLeaks and to the public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a matter of policy and implementation WikiLeaks does not collect or retain source identifying information, so fortunately, source identities for this material are not significantly at risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks has only made one prior formal statement regarding Mr. Domscheit-Berg, which we issued in February and repeat here:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks has been taking legal action against former employee, Daniel Domscheit-Berg who was suspended from the organization in September. The reasons for these actions will gradually become clear, but some are hinted at by extracts from Domscheit-Berg&#8217;s book.
In the book Domscheit-Berg confesses to various acts of sabotage against the organization. The former WikiLeaks staffer admits to having damaged the sites primary submission system and stolen material.
The sabotage and concern over motives led to an overhaul of the entire submission system, an ongoing project that is not being expedited due to its complex nature and the organization´s need to focus its resources on publication and defense.
It should be noted that Domscheit-Berg´s roles within WikiLeaks were limited and started to diminish almost a year ago as his integrity and stability were questioned. He has falsely misrepresented himself in the press as a programmer, computer-scientist, security expert, architect, editor, founder, director and spokesman. He is not a founder or co-founder and nor was there any contact with him during the founding years. He did not even have an email address with the organization until 2008 (we launched in December 2006). He cannot program and wrote not a single program for the organization, at any time.
Domscheit-Berg was never an architect for the organization, technically, or in matters of policy. He was a spokesperson for WikiLeaks in Germany at various times, but he was never the spokesman for WikiLeaks, nor was he ever WikiLeaks editor, although he subedited some articles. He was also never a computer scientist, or computer security expert, although he was a computer science student many years ago. His accounts of the crucial times in WikiLeaks history since April last year are therefore based upon limited information or malicious falsifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to provide an environment which would encourage Mr. Domscheit-Berg to return what he has stolen and not to use it for malicious purposes, we have made no further statements until today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This diplomatic silence has been difficult for us, and, is perhaps a warning lesson about secret diplomacy. While we have been silent in order to maximize the chances of regaining the material that was entrusted to us, Mr. Domscheit-Berg has issued dozens of legally harmful falsehoods including during our ongoing legal conflict with the Pentagon, during the imprisonment and investigation of two alleged sources, Bradley Manning and Rudolf Elmer and during the imprisonment and extradition hearings of our founder Julian Assange.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mr. Manning is imprisoned pending trial, Mr. Assange is under house arrest pending extradition. Over 100 WikiLeaks supporters have been arrested or raided by the FBI, Scotland Yard and other police or intelligence services. Publicly declared task forces into WikiLeaks over the last year include the Pentagon (120 personnel), the State Department, the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the CIA. Concurrently, a "secret" Grand Jury in Washington (Alexandria) has been considering whether to indict Julian Assange with espionage as a result of Wikileaks' publishing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mr. Domscheit-Berg has acted dishonestly, he has admitted to stealing WikiLeaks property, and has admitted to the deliberate sabotage of Wikileaks’ operations, impeding it from carrying out the will of its sources. He has lied, constantly, and flagrantly, to the public, to us, to our lawyers, and to the mediator, Andy Müller-Maguhn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are making this public statement in a final attempt to make Mr. Domscheit-Berg return the data he has stolen, before he destroys it. This material was entrusted to WikiLeaks specifically by our sources, who often go to significant risks to bring us materials under the basis that we will bring their revelations to the public and defend them from censorship. Every day that passes compromises the will of these sources and the efforts they have undertaken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mr. Domscheit-Berg has illegitimately taken this data along with Wikileaks’ secure online submissions system, funds and internal documentation. He has sabotaged years of work, none of which was his own. We have had to recreate this work under difficult circumstances. This rebuilding comes at a significant cost to Wikileaks, which is under an unlawful Washington instigated financial blockade enforced by the big US financial companies. This cost is ultimately borne by the public, who fight to keep our operations afloat with contributions of twenty dollars a month or less.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Statement by Julian Assange Sat Aug 20 20:21:04 2011 UTC</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks does not record or retain source identifying information, however the claimed destruction of documents entrusted to WikiLeaks between January 2010 and August 2010 demands the revelation of inside information so sources can make their own risk assessments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early in 2010, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, (then "Daniel Berg", "Daniel Schmitt") (born 1978), who was responsible for keeping selected WikiLeaks backups, met and entered into a relationship with Anke Domscheit-Berg (then, "Anke Domscheit") (born 1968) who described her job title as "Director Government Relations" for Microsoft, Germany.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DDB told me that ADB&#8217;s role was to interface with the German government on behalf of Microsoft. He was proud that he had been to a party at the German ministry of the interior, as ADB&#8217;s consort, and that ADB was on intimate terms with senior figures in the German government and bureaucracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DDB told me that he had moved into ADBs house in Berlin, without any counter-intelligence cover, going so far as to place his legal name on a street visible mail box and the interior door and that he would work from this location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point WikiLeaks issued a policy directive that DDB not be permitted contact with source material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ADB and DDB officially married within a few weeks and changed their surnames to "Domscheit-Berg".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DDB secretly, and in clear violation of WikiLeaks internal security directives, recorded internal WikiLeaks encrypted "chat" conversations. He initially publicly denied having done so, but attempted to place many of these recordings into his ghostwritten book, most of which were rejected by his publishers' lawyers as violations of german privacy law. Others he secretly conveyed to hostile media, such as Wired magazine, which had been involved in the arrest and persecution of US intelligence analyst Bradley Manning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>His book, "Inside WikiLeaks", contains many proven malicious libels and breaches of WikiLeaks security policies. The book is promoted throughout U.S. military book stores, by the U.S. military.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After DDB&#8217;s suspension in August 2010, he managed, through guile, to convince a German WikiLeaks system administrator, who was an old associate of DDB&#8217;s, to obtain the keys and data for a large quantity of then pending WikiLeaks whistleblower disclosures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the last year there has been publicly declared task forces or investigations into WikiLeaks by the CIA, the Pentagon, the FBI, the Department of State, the DoJ, ASIO, ASIS, and the AFP (the last has now been publicly cancelled, finding that no Australian laws have been broken). Many other agencies, such as the NSA have also been involved, but not publicly declared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have received a warning from a current Western intelligence officer that DDB has been in contact with the FBI, on more than one occasion, and that the information from this contact was "helpful". I do not know if DDB was complicit with the reported contact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David House, of the Bradley Manning Support Network, stated publicly, and repeatedly, that U.S. investigative authorities attempted to bribe him to become an informant and infiltrate WikiLeaks activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have been told that the girlfriend of a Berlin-based Israeli intelligence officer attended the wedding of ADB and DDB. This may not be significant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have received intelligence from current Western intelligence officer, that Anke Domscheit Berg, personally, came into contact with the CIA during her time working for the McKinsey &amp; Company consulting group. This was a direct, volunteered statement of fact and warning, and not a statement of speculation. I do not know if ADB was complicit in the reported
contact.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks editorial 1 September 2011: Guardian journalist negligently disclosed Cablegate passwords</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/Guardian-journalist-negligently.html" class="bare">https://wikileaks.org/Guardian-journalist-negligently.html</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Guardian journalist has negligently disclosed top secret WikiLeaks' decryption passwords to hundreds of thousands of unredacted unpublished US diplomatic cables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowledge of the Guardian disclosure has spread privately over several months but reached critical mass last week. The unpublished WikiLeaks' material includes over 100,000 classified unredacted cables that were being analyzed, in parts, by over 50 media and human rights organizations from around the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the past month WikiLeaks has been in the unenviable position of not being able to comment on what has happened, since to do so would be to draw attention to the decryption passwords in the Guardian book. Now that the connection has been made public by others we can explain what happened and what we intend to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks has commenced pre-litigation action against the Guardian and an individual in Germany who was distributing the Guardian passwords for personal gain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the past nine months, WikiLeaks has been releasing US diplomatic cables according to a carefully laid out plan to stimulate profound changes. A number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, believe that the co-ordinated release of the cables contributed to triggering the Arab Spring. By forming partnerships with over 90 other media and human rights organizations WikiLeaks has been laying the ground for positive political change all over the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks method involves a sophisticated procedure of packaging leaked US diplomatic cables up into country groups or themes, such as 'resources corruption', and providing it to those organizations that agreed to do the most research in exchange for time-limited exclusivity. As part of the WikiLeaks agreement, these groups, using their local knowledge, remove the names of persons reporting unjust acts to US embassies, and feed the results back to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks then publishes, simultaneously with its partners, the underlying cables together with the politically explosive revelations. This way publications that are too frightened to publish the cables have the proof they need, and the public can check to make sure the claims are accurate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time WikiLeaks has been building up, and publishing, the complete Cablegate "library"--the most significant political document ever published. The mammoth task of reading and lightly redacting what amounts to 3,000 volumes or 284 million words of global political history is shared by WikiLeaks and its partners. That careful work has been compromised as a result of the recklessness of the Guardian.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revolutions and reforms are in danger of being lost as the unpublished cables spread to intelligence contractors and governments before the public. The Arab Spring would not have started in the manner it did if the Tunisian government of Ben Ali had copies of those WikiLeaks releases which helped to take down his government. Similarly, it is possible that the torturing Egyptian internal security chief, Suleiman&#8212;&#8203;Washington&#8217;s proposed replacement for Mubarak&#8212;&#8203;would now be the acting ruler of Egypt, had he acquired copies of the cables that exposed his methods prior to their publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Indeed, it is one of the indelible stains on Hillary Clinton that she personally set course to forewarn dozens of corrupt leaders, including Hosni Mubarak, about some of the most powerful details of WikiLeaks' revelations to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every day that the corrupt leadership of a country or organization knows of a pending WikiLeaks disclosure is a day spent planning how to crush revolution and reform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Guardian investigations editor, David Leigh, recklessly, and without gaining our approval, knowingly disclosed the decryption passwords in a book published by the Guardian. Leigh states the book was rushed forward to be written in three weeks&#8212;&#8203;the rights were then sold to Hollywood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following extract is from the Guardian book:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{Leigh tried his best not to fall out with this Australian impresario, who was prone to criticise what he called the “snaky Brits”. Instead, Leigh used his ever-shifting demands as a negotiating lever. “You want us to postpone the Iraq logs’ publication so you can get some TV,” he said. [WikiLeaks: We required more time for redactions and to complete three Iraq war documentaries commissioned through the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The documentaries were syndicated through Channel 4 (UK) and al Jazeera English and Arabic] “We could refuse, and simply go ahead with publication as planned. If you want us to do something for you, then you’ve got to do something for us as well.” He asked Assange to stop procrastinating, and hand over the biggest trove of all: the cables. Assange said, “I could give you half of them, covering the first 50% of the period.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leigh refused. All or nothing, he said. “What happens if you end up in an orange jump-suit en route to Guantánamo before you can release the full files?” In return he would give Assange a promise to keep the cables secure, and not to publish them until the time came. Assange had always been vague about timing: he generally indicated, however, that October would be a suitable date. He believed the US army’s charges against the imprisoned soldier Bradley Manning would have crystallised by then, and publication could not make his fate any worse. He also said, echoing Leigh’s gallows humour: “I’m going to need to be safe in Cuba first!” Eventually, Assange capitulated. Late at night, after a two-hour debate, he started the process on one of his little netbooks that would enable Leigh to download the entire tranche of cables. The Guardian journalist had to set up the PGP encryption system on his laptop at home across the other side of London. Then he could feed in a password. Assange wrote down on a scrap of paper:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[WikiLeaks: we have replaced the password with Xs] XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“That’s the password,” he said. “But you have to add one extra word when you type it in. You have to put in the word ‘XXXXXXX’ before the word ‘XXXXXX’ [WikiLeaks: so if the paper were seized, the password would not work without Leigh&#8217;s co-operation] Can you remember that?” “I can remember that.” Leigh set off home, and successfully installed the PGP software.}</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian disclosure is a violation of the confidentiality agreement between WikiLeaks and Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, signed July 30, 2010. David Leigh is also Alan Rusbridger&#8217;s brother in law, which has caused other Guardian journalists to claim that David Leigh has been unfairly protected from the fallout. It is not the first time the WikiLeaks security agreement has been violated by the Guardian.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks severed future projects with the Guardian in December last year after it was discovered that the Guardian was engaged in a conspiracy to publish the cables without the knowledge of WikiLeaks, seriously compromising the security of our people in the United States and an alleged source who was in pre-trial detention. Leigh, without any basis, and in a flagrant violation of journalistic ethics, named Bradley Manning as the Cablegate source in his book. David Leigh secretly passed the entire archive to Bill Keller of the New York Times, in September 2011, or before, knowingly destroying WikiLeaks plans to publish instead with the Washington Post &amp; McClatchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David Leigh and the Guardian have subsequently and repeatedly violated WikiLeaks security conditions, including our requirements that the unpublished cables be kept safe from state intelligence services by keeping them only on computers not connected to the internet. Ian Katz, Deputy Editor of the Guardian admitted in December 2010 meeting that this condition was not being followed by the Guardian.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PJ Crowley, State Department spokesman on the cables issue earlier this year, told AP on the 30th of August, 2011 that “any autocratic security service worth its salt” would probably already have the complete unredacted archive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two weeks ago, when it was discovered that information about the Leigh book had spread so much that it was about to be published in the German weekly Freitag, WikiLeaks took emergency action, asking the editor not allude to the Leigh book, and tasked its lawyers to demand those maliciously spreading its details about the Leigh book stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks advanced its regular publication schedule, to get as much of the material as possible into the hands of journalists and human rights lawyers who need it. WikiLeaks and its partners were scheduled to have published most of the Cablegate material by November 29, 2011 – one year since the first publication. Over the past week, we have published over 130,000 cables, mostly unclassified. The cables have lead to hundreds of important news stories around the world. All were unclassified with the exception of the Australian, Swedish collections, and a few others, which were scheduled by our partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks has also been in contact with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty at a senior level. We contacted the US embassy in London and then the State Department in Washington on 25 August to see if their informant notification program, instituted last year, was complete, and if not, to take such steps as would be helpful. Only after repeated attempts through high level channels and 36 hours after our first contact, did the State Department, although it had been made aware of the issue, respond. Cliff Johnson (a legal advisor at the Department of State) spoke to Julian Assange for 75 minutes, but the State Department decided not to meet in person to receive further information, which could not, at that stage, be safely transmitted over the telephone.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — In a shift of tactics that has alarmed American officials, the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks has published on the Web nearly 134,000 leaked diplomatic cables in recent days, more than six times the total disclosed publicly since the posting of the leaked State Department documents began last November.</p>

<p>A sampling of the documents showed that the newly published cables included the names of some people who had spoken confidentially to American diplomats and whose identities were marked in the cables with the warning “strictly protect.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State Department officials and human rights activists have been concerned that such diplomatic sources, including activists, journalists and academics in authoritarian countries, could face reprisals, including dismissal from their jobs, prosecution or violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since late 2010, The New York Times and several other news organizations have had access to more than 250,000 State Department cables originally obtained by WikiLeaks, citing them in news articles and publishing a relatively small number of cables deemed newsworthy. But The Times and other publications that had access to the documents removed the names of people judged vulnerable to retaliation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks published some cables on its own Web site, but until the latest release, the group had also provided versions of the cables that had been edited to protect low-level diplomatic sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Government officials and journalists were poring over the newly released cables on Monday to assess whether people named in them might face repercussions. A quick sampling found at least one cable posted on Monday, from the American Embassy in Australia, had a name removed, but several others left in the identities of people whom diplomats had flagged for protection.</p>

<p>Among those named, despite diplomats’ warnings, were a United Nations official in West Africa and a foreign human rights activist working in Cambodia. They had spoken candidly to American Embassy officials on the understanding that they would not be publicly identified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new disclosures are likely to reignite a debate over the virtues and perils of making public the confidential views of American diplomats, some of whom have complained that the leaks have made their work more difficult. The disclosures take place as a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., continues to hear evidence in a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks for disclosing classified information.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks said in a statement on Monday that the acceleration in disclosing the cables was “in accordance with WikiLeaks’s commitment to maximizing impact and making information available to all.” The statement suggested that it was intended to counter the “misperception” that the organization “has been less active in recent months.”

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statement said that “crowdsourcing” the documents by posting them will allow people of different backgrounds and nationalities to interpret the cables. It was unsigned, but WikiLeaks’s founder, Julian Assange, generally drafts or approves the group’s statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even as WikiLeaks made its new postings, a German publication reported that an encrypted file containing all of the 251,287 diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks last year had been posted months ago on the Web, and that the password was also available on the Internet. It was unclear on Monday whether anyone had cracked the encrypted file described by the publication, Der Freitag, a small Berlin-based, left-leaning weekly, and had made public previously unpublished material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A State Department spokesman, Michael A. Hammer, said the department would not comment on the authenticity of the documents released. He said the United States “strongly condemns any illegal disclosure of classified information.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last year, WikiLeaks was sharply criticized by human rights activists for disclosing the names of Afghan citizens who had provided information on the Taliban to the American military. It was far more cautious in subsequent releases, using software to strip proper names out of Iraq war documents and publishing versions of the cables after they had been edited by The New York Times and other publications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The publication of cables began slowly last year, with only 2,500 made public by year’s end, often with redactions. As of last week, the total had reached about 20,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the State Department has always acted on the assumption that all quarter-million cables might become public. A department task force worked with American embassies to review all the leaked cables, quietly warning people named in the cables that they might be in jeopardy. Some especially vulnerable people were given help to move, usually outside their home countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Steven Aftergood, an expert on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, said he had reviewed several dozen cables from the new batch — all among those classified “secret” by the State Department — and found only one redaction. He said the volume of the new release made it unlikely that all the information that might endanger diplomatic sources had been removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“If these cables have not been carefully reviewed, it’s likely to be problematic for any number of people named in the cables,” Mr. Aftergood said.</p>

<p>A Dispatch Disaster in Six Acts
Some 250,000 diplomatic dispatches from the US State Department have accidentally been made completely public. The files include the names of informants who now must fear for their lives. It is the result of a series of blunders by WikiLeaks and its supporters.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, all the efforts at confidentiality came to naught. Everyone who knows a bit about computers can now have a look into the 250,000 US diplomatic dispatches that WikiLeaks made available to select news outlets late last year. All of them. What&#8217;s more, they are the unedited, unredacted versions complete with the names of US diplomats' informants&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sensitive names from Iran, China, Afghanistan, the Arab world and elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPIEGEL reported on the secrecy slip-up last weekend, but declined to go into detail. Now, however, the story has blown up. And is one that comes as a result of a series of mistakes made by several different people. Together, they add up to a catastrophe. And the series of events reads like the script for a B movie.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Act One: The Whistleblower and the Journalist</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story began with a secret deal. When David Leigh of the Guardian finally found himself sitting across from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as the British journalist recounts in his book "Inside Julian Assange&#8217;s War on Secrecy", the two agreed that Assange would provide Leigh with a file including all of the diplomatic dispatches received by WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange placed the file on a server and wrote down the password on a slip of paper&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but not the entire password. To make it work, one had to complete the list of characters with a certain word. Can you remember it? Assange asked. Of course, responded Leigh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was the first step in a disclosure that became a worldwide sensation. As a result of Leigh&#8217;s meeting with Assange, not only the Guardian, but also the New York Times, SPIEGEL and other media outlets published carefully chosen&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and redacted&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;dispatches. Editors were at pains to black out the names of informants who could be endangered by the publication of the documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Act Two: The German Spokesman Takes the Dispatch File when Leaving WikiLeaks</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the time, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who later founded the site OpenLeaks, was the German spokesman for WikiLeaks. When he and others undertook repairs on the WikiLeaks server, he took a dataset off the server which contained all manner of files and information that had been provided to WikiLeaks. What he apparently didn&#8217;t know at the time, however, was that the dataset included the complete collection of diplomatic dispatches hidden in a difficult-to-find sub-folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After making the data in this hidden sub-folder available to Leigh, Assange apparently simply left it there. After all, it seemed unlikely that anyone would ever find it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now, the dataset was in the hands of Domscheit-Berg. And the password was easy to find if one knew where to look. In his book Leigh didn&#8217;t just describe his meeting with Assange, but he also printed the password Assange wrote down on the slip of paper complete with the portion he had to remember.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Act Three: Well-Meaning Helpers Accidentally Put the Cables into Circulation</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immediately after the first diplomatic dispatches were made public, WikiLeaks became the target of several denial-of-service attacks and several US companies, including Mastercard, PayPal and Amazon, withdrew their support. Quickly, several mirror servers were set up to prevent WikiLeaks from disappearing completely from the Internet. Well-meaning WikiLeaks supporters also put online a compressed version of all data that had been published by WikiLeaks until that time via the filesharing protocol BitTorrent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BitTorrent is decentralized. Data which ends up on several other computers via the site can essentially no longer be recalled. As a result, WikiLeaks supporters had in their possession the entire dataset that Domscheit-Berg took off the WikiLeaks server, including the hidden data file. Presumably thousands of WikiLeaks sympathizers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and, one supposes, numerous secret service agents&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;now had copies of all previous WikiLeaks publications on their hard drives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, what they didn&#8217;t know, a password-protected copy of all the diplomatic dispatches from the US State Department.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Act Four: Mudslinging between Assange and Domscheit-Berg</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make matters worse, Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg then had a falling out. The German spokesman wrote a vengeful book after being thrown out of WikiLeaks in which he portrayed the WikiLeaks founder as an unreliable egomaniac who tended toward latent megalomania.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Predictably, Assange was furious and made several statements that were intended to besmirch Domscheit-Berg. But when he repaired the WikiLeaks server, Domscheit-Berg apparently didn&#8217;t just take all of the collected WikiLeaks documents, but he also took the secure submission system designed to allow whistleblowers to anonymously submit data. As a result, WikiLeaks was temporarily out of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domscheit-Berg also repeatedly accused Assange of not being sufficiently vigilant about protecting his sources. And he launched a competing platform called OpenLeaks which he is now developing with other former WikiLeaks employees and other supporters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Act Five : Exposed Disclosures</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conflict between Domscheit-Berg and Assange has become increasingly aggressive. Germany&#8217;s Chaos Computer Club recently made the surprising decision to revoke Domscheit-Berg&#8217;s membership because he allegedly misused their name to hype his OpenLeaks project. While that was their official reason, unofficially the tension stems from the data that Domscheit-Berg took with him from Wikileaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an effort to prove that Assange couldn&#8217;t be trusted, people associated with the OpenLeaks project recently began talking about the hidden diplomatic cables&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the dataset which has been coursing through the Internet for months, though no one knew about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then someone betrayed the location of the password&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Leigh&#8217;s book&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to a journalist for German weekly Der Freitag, which is also an OpenLeaks partner. The weekly published a cautiously formulated version of the story, that without naming the exact location of the password, still revealed it was "out in the open and identifiable to those familiar with the material." Speculation on Twitter and elsewhere ran wild, and hobby investigators began to edge closer to which password it could be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile the mudslinging continued unabated between Assange and Domscheit-Berg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Act Six: Cablegate-Gate</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An account of the story of Leigh, the hidden data and the password then cropped up on a platform normally used by open-source developers to exchange programming codes. A link to the entry spread quickly through Twitter. Suddenly, anyone could access the entire "Cablegate" file with a bit of effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Wednesday afternoon the Wikileaks Twitter account announced "important news," and a few hours later character sequences and links were distributed to download an encoded, 550-megabyte file via a BitTorrent client. The password was to be delivered later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The distribution apparently didn&#8217;t work at first, and complaints appeared on Twitter. But later the problem was fixed, and the data began to circulate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It remains unclear whether this was the Cablegate data set. Meanwhile Wikileaks' Twitter account has called on users to vote on whether they agree with the publication of the unredacted cables. They can register their vote with the hashtag "WLVoteYes" or "WLVoteNo" on Twitter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Wikileaks statement on Twitter blames the Guardian and Leigh for the fact that the cables are now freely available online. "We have already spoken to the (US) State Department and commenced pre-litigation action," it said, adding that their targets were the Guardian and a person in Germany who gave out the paper&#8217;s password. Leigh breached a confidentiality agreement between Wikileaks and the Guardian, it added. The US Embassy in London and the US State Department had been notified of the possible publication already on August 25 so that officials could warn informants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a statement the Guardian rejected the accusations from Wikileaks, explaining that the paper had been told the password was temporary and would be deleted within hours. "No concerns were expressed when the book was published and if anyone at WikiLeaks had thought this compromised security they have had seven months to remove the files," the statement said. "That they didn&#8217;t do so clearly shows the problem was not caused by the Guardian&#8217;s book."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finale: In the Open</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible that intelligence agencies in a number of countries have already gained access to the data. "Any autocratic security service worth its salt" would have already done so, former US Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs P.J. Crowley told news agency AP on Wednesday. Intelligence agencies that haven&#8217;t already gotten their hands on the data "will have it in short order," he added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By Wednesday evening Crowley&#8217;s prediction was confirmed. The "Cablegate" cables are now completely public. For many people in totalitarian states this could prove life-threatening. For Wikileaks, OpenLeaks, Julian Assange, Daniel Domscheit-Berg and many others, it is nothing short of a catastrophe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A chain of careless mistakes, coincidences, indiscretions and confusion now means that no potential whistleblower would feel comfortable turning to a leaking platform right now. They appear to be out of control.</p>

<p>WIKILEAKS EDITORIAL</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Guardian journalist has negligently disclosed top secret WikiLeaks' decryption passwords to hundreds of thousands of unredacted unpublished US diplomatic cables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowledge of the Guardian disclosure has spread privately over several months but reached critical mass last week. The unpublished WikiLeaks' material includes over 100,000 classified unredacted cables that were being analyzed, in parts, by over 50 media and human rights organizations from around the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the past month WikiLeaks has been in the unenviable position of not being able to comment on what has happened, since to do so would be to draw attention to the decryption passwords in the Guardian book. Now that the connection has been made public by others we can explain what happened and what we intend to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks has commenced pre-litigation action against the Guardian and an individual in Germany who was distributing the Guardian passwords for personal gain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the past nine months, WikiLeaks has been releasing US diplomatic cables according to a carefully laid out plan to stimulate profound changes. A number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, believe that the co-ordinated release of the cables contributed to triggering the Arab Spring. By forming partnerships with over 90 other media and human rights organizations WikiLeaks has been laying the ground for positive political change all over the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks method involves a sophisticated procedure of packaging leaked US diplomatic cables up into country groups or themes, such as 'resources corruption', and providing it to those organizations that agreed to do the most research in exchange for time-limited exclusivity. As part of the WikiLeaks agreement, these groups, using their local knowledge, remove the names of persons reporting unjust acts to US embassies, and feed the results back to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks then publishes, simultaneously with its partners, the underlying cables together with the politically explosive revelations. This way publications that are too frightened to publish the cables have the proof they need, and the public can check to make sure the claims are accurate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time WikiLeaks has been building up, and publishing, the complete Cablegate "library"--the most significant political document ever published. The mammoth task of reading and lightly redacting what amounts to 3,000 volumes or 284 million words of global political history is shared by WikiLeaks and its partners. That careful work has been compromised as a result of the recklessness of the Guardian.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revolutions and reforms are in danger of being lost as the unpublished cables spread to intelligence contractors and governments before the public. The Arab Spring would not have started in the manner it did if the Tunisian government of Ben Ali had copies of those WikiLeaks releases which helped to take down his government. Similarly, it is possible that the torturing Egyptian internal security chief, Suleiman&#8212;&#8203;Washington&#8217;s proposed replacement for Mubarak&#8212;&#8203;would now be the acting ruler of Egypt, had he acquired copies of the cables that exposed his methods prior to their publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Indeed, it is one of the indelible stains on Hillary Clinton that she personally set course to forewarn dozens of corrupt leaders, including Hosni Mubarak, about some of the most powerful details of WikiLeaks' revelations to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every day that the corrupt leadership of a country or organization knows of a pending WikiLeaks disclosure is a day spent planning how to crush revolution and reform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Guardian investigations editor, David Leigh, recklessly, and without gaining our approval, knowingly disclosed the decryption passwords in a book published by the Guardian. Leigh states the book was rushed forward to be written in three weeks&#8212;&#8203;the rights were then sold to Hollywood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following extract is from the Guardian book:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{Leigh tried his best not to fall out with this Australian impresario, who was prone to criticise what he called the “snaky Brits”. Instead, Leigh used his ever-shifting demands as a negotiating lever. “You want us to postpone the Iraq logs’ publication so you can get some TV,” he said. [WikiLeaks: We required more time for redactions and to complete three Iraq war documentaries commissioned through the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The documentaries were syndicated through Channel 4 (UK) and al Jazeera English and Arabic] “We could refuse, and simply go ahead with publication as planned. If you want us to do something for you, then you’ve got to do something for us as well.” He asked Assange to stop procrastinating, and hand over the biggest trove of all: the cables. Assange said, “I could give you half of them, covering the first 50% of the period.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leigh refused. All or nothing, he said. “What happens if you end up in an orange jump-suit en route to Guantánamo before you can release the full files?” In return he would give Assange a promise to keep the cables secure, and not to publish them until the time came. Assange had always been vague about timing: he generally indicated, however, that October would be a suitable date. He believed the US army’s charges against the imprisoned soldier Bradley Manning would have crystallised by then, and publication could not make his fate any worse. He also said, echoing Leigh’s gallows humour: “I’m going to need to be safe in Cuba first!” Eventually, Assange capitulated. Late at night, after a two-hour debate, he started the process on one of his little netbooks that would enable Leigh to download the entire tranche of cables. The Guardian journalist had to set up the PGP encryption system on his laptop at home across the other side of London. Then he could feed in a password. Assange wrote down on a scrap of paper:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[WikiLeaks: we have replaced the password with Xs] XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“That’s the password,” he said. “But you have to add one extra word when you type it in. You have to put in the word ‘XXXXXXX’ before the word ‘XXXXXX’ [WikiLeaks: so if the paper were seized, the password would not work without Leigh&#8217;s co-operation] Can you remember that?” “I can remember that.” Leigh set off home, and successfully installed the PGP software.}</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian disclosure is a violation of the confidentiality agreement between WikiLeaks and Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, signed July 30, 2010. David Leigh is also Alan Rusbridger&#8217;s brother in law, which has caused other Guardian journalists to claim that David Leigh has been unfairly protected from the fallout. It is not the first time the WikiLeaks security agreement has been violated by the Guardian.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks severed future projects with the Guardian in December last year after it was discovered that the Guardian was engaged in a conspiracy to publish the cables without the knowledge of WikiLeaks, seriously compromising the security of our people in the United States and an alleged source who was in pre-trial detention. Leigh, without any basis, and in a flagrant violation of journalistic ethics, named Bradley Manning as the Cablegate source in his book. David Leigh secretly passed the entire archive to Bill Keller of the New York Times, in September 2011, or before, knowingly destroying WikiLeaks plans to publish instead with the Washington Post &amp; McClatchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David Leigh and the Guardian have subsequently and repeatedly violated WikiLeaks security conditions, including our requirements that the unpublished cables be kept safe from state intelligence services by keeping them only on computers not connected to the internet. Ian Katz, Deputy Editor of the Guardian admitted in December 2010 meeting that this condition was not being followed by the Guardian.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PJ Crowley, State Department spokesman on the cables issue earlier this year, told AP on the 30th of August, 2011 that “any autocratic security service worth its salt” would probably already have the complete unredacted archive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two weeks ago, when it was discovered that information about the Leigh book had spread so much that it was about to be published in the German weekly Freitag, WikiLeaks took emergency action, asking the editor not allude to the Leigh book, and tasked its lawyers to demand those maliciously spreading its details about the Leigh book stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks advanced its regular publication schedule, to get as much of the material as possible into the hands of journalists and human rights lawyers who need it. WikiLeaks and its partners were scheduled to have published most of the Cablegate material by November 29, 2011 – one year since the first publication. Over the past week, we have published over 130,000 cables, mostly unclassified. The cables have lead to hundreds of important news stories around the world. All were unclassified with the exception of the Australian, Swedish collections, and a few others, which were scheduled by our partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks has also been in contact with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty at a senior level. We contacted the US embassy in London and then the State Department in Washington on 25 August to see if their informant notification program, instituted last year, was complete, and if not, to take such steps as would be helpful. Only after repeated attempts through high level channels and 36 hours after our first contact, did the State Department, although it had been made aware of the issue, respond. Cliff Johnson (a legal advisor at the Department of State) spoke to Julian Assange for 75 minutes, but the State Department decided not to meet in person to receive further information, which could not, at that stage, be safely transmitted over the telephone.</p>

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few months later, Wikileaks publicly posted a huge archive of previously released material to ensure continued access to it following Assange’s legal troubles and attacks on their website.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At that time only a few thousand of the more than 250,000 cables had been published, and only in redacted form to protect US diplomatic sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the 250,000 cables were not in the archive, it included a mysterious encrypted file called “z.gpg” – which appears to have been created months before Wikileaks gave the cables to the media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In February 2011, Leigh’s book “WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange’s War on Secrecy” was published. In it he described how Assange passed the cables to the Guardian, along with the password he was given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There matters sat until Aug. 25 when the website of German newspaper Der Freitag connected the old password with the mysterious “z.gpg” file, although they did not name the file or print the password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But others clearly knew. By Wednesday, Aug. 29th, a few Twitter users were hinting that the password in Leigh’s book worked, and others were drawing attention to “z.gpg.” Within hours, public links to the full, unencrypted cables appeared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By Thursday morning, the cables were easily available from several file sharing sites commonly used for pirated music and movies.</p>

<p>On a basic security level, revealing any information about how Julian Assange formulates his passwords could have implications in any of the other myriad of sensitive areas Wikileaks deals with. Any files encrypted by Assange at the same time—or before—the cables, and in the possession of any entity hostile to Wikileaks, are now more vulnerable since Leigh&#8217;s book gave up its clue about how Assange formulates passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And anyone who has access to the original file David Leigh was given, could now decrypt it. Unless the original file was carefully protected throughout its entire life, decrypted and unzipped, then destroyed after the data was released, that password will work on copies of it for ever. No backsies. So regardless how David Leigh &amp; Co. imagine computer security works—and right now they are desperately trying increasingly ridiculous arguments to blame Wikileaks for Leigh&#8217;s actions—there&#8217;s no reason to publish any password this sensitive—ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The entire Leigh/Harding Wikileaks book is written in the thrilled tone of a girl scout&#8217;s diary, clearly reveling in the secret squirrel aspect of the story. And they&#8217;re clearly clueless too. Leigh at one point drives across town so Assange can show him how to unzip the Cablegate file. Perhaps not the best people to share secrets with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cat out the bag
On August 25th, Der Freitag reported that a file containing the unredacted cables was available on the Internet. TechCrunch summarized the story a couple of days later:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>In the story, published on Friday, editor Steffen Kraft claims to have found online a “password protected csv file” containing a 1.73GB cache of entirely unredacted diplomatic cables, originating from Wikileaks. According to Kraft, the password for the file is also easy to locate.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On August 29th, Der Spiegel confirmed the story&#8230;&#8203;MORE IF WANTED</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the two German reports, it became clear that a torrented mirror of Wikileaks had accidently included an encrypted copy of the Cablegate cables. And that the password was easy to find on the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This last part immediately brought to mind the Guardian&#8217;s Wikileaks book and David Leigh and Luke Harding&#8217;s inexplicable need to tell people the password for the original encrypted Cablegate file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, none of the German reporters wanted to be the one to mention which password and which archive. In the case of both, there aren&#8217;t that many options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was Domscheit-Berg who allegedly connected the dots for the German media organizations. Unparalleled Wikileaks news follower and gatherer Asher Wolf later perhaps best summed up the tangled web with a tweet quoting an anonymous Twitter user, @Nin_99, who played a significant role in the treasure hunt:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>wl fucked up b/c they had file on public server, leigh fucked up b/c he told everyone the pw, ddb told everyone who would listen about all</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Surely it couldn&#8217;t be that easy? In the evening of August 30th, I started searching the various Wikileaks torrents online and that I&#8217;d downloaded, looking in directories for encrypted file. I wrote to several of the German journalists who had broke the story and asked them outright if David Leigh&#8217;s password opened the archive. No response. I asked David Leigh himself. He declined to respond.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tweeted other people who closely follow the Wikileaks story. It was a treasure hunt with clues. Anonymous Twitter user, @Nin_99, joined in and messaged us, pointing to a suspicious directory on a downloaded Wikileaks torrent, shared online:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>@flyingmonkeyair @JLLLOW @Asher_Wolf @m_cetera Anyone might guess what's in these here: http://193.198.207.6/wiki/file/xyz/ (from torrent)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>https://twitter.com/#!/Nin_99/status/108988882862870529</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>@Nin_99 had been exploring the directory for a few days, trying different passwords on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the directory, date-stamped 9 June 2010, were 4 files, all encoded with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encoding, the files names with *.gpg suffixes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started at the bottom of the list, putting in the David Leigh password. It unzipped z.gpg into a file called z.7z. Opening that file and extracting it using the Ez7z compression/decompression program, the file spat out a file called cables.csv, dated with a creation date of April 12, 2010 at 9:22PM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a 1.61GB file but it had been reported in the German press to be 1.73GB. A closer look at my file system reporting showed the file size to be both 1.61 GB and 1,730,507,223 bytes. It was easy to see how the byte amount could be mistranslated as 1.73GB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So there it was. After Wikileaks, the various media partners, Aftenposten—who apparently scored a copy of cables.csv back in December 2010—and the German reporters, I was the first person out of the loop and in the wild to have unzipped the unredacted Cablegate cables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I private messaged @Nin_99 to save them some time and let them know the password opened z.gpg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Game over at this point. The cat was forever out of the bag. Regardless even of what we both did, it was only a matter of time before someone else unpacked the unredacted cables. The various media organization&#8217;s hints were more than enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tweeted:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>It's a bad day for @DavidLeigh3 &amp; the Guardian. His book password decrypts an old wikileaks.org dir file into cables.csv, 1.61GB #Cablegate</pre>

<p>Julian Assnage To Appeal Against Extradition

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, parted company with mainstream opinion when Assange revealed his intention to make public all 250,000 raw US state department cables that have been in his hands since last year, regardless of possible reprisals to named individuals. This flies in the face of efforts by the Guardian and other news organisations to redact references to confidential informants before publishing selected cables: efforts which may now appear to have been largely wasted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s plans were foreshadowed at a secret meeting of the WikiLeaks team last November. The diary of one of those present at Ellingham Hall, the stately home which was then their base, records: "Heated conversation about rough plans on releasing cables … JA insistent all cables must somehow eventually be released." His wish has now been realised, after a year punctuated by his arrest, heated quarrels with former associates, and a chapter of accidents within Assange&#8217;s chaotic organisation. A few days after the Ellingham Hall meeting Assange turned himself in for arrest on an extradition warrant sought by Sweden, on allegations of sexual assault by two young WikiLeaks supporters there. He is still fighting extradition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 7 December, the day of his arrest, a huge file of WikiLeaks information was posted on the Pirate Bay filesharing site by one of his supporters. According to the group&#8217;s former No 2, computer expert Daniel Domscheit-Berg: "These people said they wanted to keep WikiLeaks operational, but they never spoke to Julian." As a result, it was never apparently realised that the file-set included Assange&#8217;s copy of all the classified US cables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Earlier in the year, according to Domscheit-Berg, Assange gave a copy of the cables file to the Guardian, one of the news organisations with whom he had agreed to work to publish the cables in redacted form. He provided the Guardian with a password and access to a special online server, on which he said he would place a copy of the cables file, which would only remain in existence for a short time. What Assange did not reveal was that he had not followed conventional security practice and created a new password for the transaction. Instead, according to Domscheit-Berg, he had merely reused the existing master password, already known to others within WikiLeaks. "The file was never supposed to be shared with anyone at all. To get a copy you would usually make a new copy with a new password. He was too lazy to create something new."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early this year the Guardian published a book on WikiLeaks. In the course of it the password Assange had provided, assumed to be long obsolete, was published. The book contained no information that would enable anyone to find and download the encrypted file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This series of events has had unplanned consequences in recent weeks. Domscheit-Berg, who says he parted company with Assange over security concerns among other reasons, ended up alleging to a German newspaper, Freitag, that WikiLeaks was insecure. He said a file existed on the internet that contained the raw cables, and was capable of being accessed by the published password. He and Freitag took care to provide no location information that would enable the file to be accessed by any member of the public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quarrel with Domscheit-Berg seemed to have had seismic consequences for Assange, who is still awaiting the result of his extradition appeal. He published unsubstantiated accusations that Domscheit-Berg had links with western intelligence agencies, and started to pump out tens of thousands of previously unpublished cables, mostly apparently unredacted. "He feared he would not be the one any more to be publishing them," says Domscheit-Berg. "He is so egocentric and completely irrational."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To protests from the Australian and US governments that he was endangering sources, Assange dropped a series of hints on Twitter as to the location of the cables file on the internet. He followed this up with a claim that he was now publishing new material because the Guardian had "betrayed" his password seven months earlier. Assange&#8217;s claims about the Guardian were untrue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK so WikiLeaks redacted the files but then the whole thing went online and it was not the redacted version???</p>

<p>February 2011 David Leigh of The Guardian published the encryption passphrase in a book. August 2011, German weekly Der Freitag published some of these details, enabling others to piece the information together and decrypt the Cablegate files. The cables were then available online, fully unredacted. In response, WikiLeaks decided on 1 September 2011 to publish all 251,287 unedited documents.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks is conducting an online poll of its Twitter followers to decide whether the whistleblowing site should publish in full its unredacted cache of US diplomatic cables. The site last week released more than 120,000 of its cache of diplomatic cables, with almost no redactions to protect the identity of informants and other individuals. The huge scale of the release, compared with 20,000 cables disclosed in the past nine months, prompted fierce criticism from the Australian government and former US state department spokesman PJ Crowley. WikiLeaks appeared likely to use the Twitter responses, which it said favoured disclosure at a ratio of 100 to one, to pave the way for imminent disclosure of the remaining material from its cable archive. The majority of cables published in the past week by WikiLeaks were unclassified but the site released the full archives, including confidential and secret cables, from Sweden and Australia. The Australian cables, which unlike previous releases were not apparently redacted, included a document identifying 23 Australians alleged to have links with al-Qaida, prompting an angry response from Robert McClelland, Australia&#8217;s attorney general.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fails to mention that archive is already being shared widely, discusses a second file red herring??.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, at a later stage the same encrypted file and at least one other encrypted with the same password was posted on the peer-to-peer file-sharing network BitTorrent. One of these files was first published on 7 December 2010, just hours before Assange&#8217;s arrest. In the days running up to his arrest, Assange had spoken of "taking precautions" in the event of anything untoward happening to him. This file, it was later discovered, was the same file that had been shared with the Guardian via the secure server. It shared the same file name and file size, and could be unlocked using the same password as that given to Leigh. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former member of staff at WikiLeaks who is attempting to set up a rival whistleblowing website, discovered this republished file and shared information on WikiLeaks&#8217;s security breach with a small group of journalists. Avoiding the re-use of passwords and avoiding republishing temporary files are both considered basic security procedures among online security experts. However, the file was not discovered or downloaded by the public. By 10am on Thursday it had been accessed once in the previous 31 days, despite mounting speculation about its existence. Initial news stories did not give details of the location of files or of passwords. Later, WikiLeaks and some of its supporters published a series of hints about the passwords and files. At about 11pm on Wednesday an anonymous Twitter user discovered the published password and opened a separate file – not the one shared with the Guardian – that had also been circulating on file-sharing networks for several months. There was no evidence that any member of the public had sufficient information to find and decrypt the files even hours before their discovery.</p>

He and Freitag took care to provide no location information that would enable the file to be accessed by any member of the public&#8230;&#8203; To protests from the Australian and US governments that he was endangering sources, Assange dropped a series of hints on Twitter as to the location of the cables file on the internet. He followed this up with a claim that he was now publishing new material because the Guardian had "betrayed" his password seven months earlier. Assange&#8217;s claims about the Guardian were untrue.</p>

<p>A statement from the Guardian said: "It&#8217;s nonsense to suggest the Guardian&#8217;s WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way. Our book about WikiLeaks was published last February. It contained a password, but no details of the location of the files, and we were told it was a temporary password which would expire and be deleted in a matter of hours. It was a meaningless piece of information to anyone except the person(s) who created the database. No concerns were expressed when the book was published and if anyone at WikiLeaks had thought this compromised security they have had seven months to remove the files. That they didn&#8217;t do so clearly shows the problem was not caused by the Guardian&#8217;s book."</p>

<p>I  joined WikiLeaks last November as a staffer for a three-month stint&#8230;&#8203; Julian mustered funds from celebrity backers. But trying to use WikiLeaks' precarious resources to fight a personal legal action was, to my view, morally indefensible. .. Shamir was introduced to the team under the pseudonym Adam, and it was only several weeks after he had left – with a huge cache of unredacted cables – that most of us started to find out who he was&#8230;&#8203; Shamir had been seen leaving the interior ministry of Belarus, an eastern European dictatorship. The next day, the country&#8217;s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, boasted he would start a Belarusian WikiLeaks showing the US was funding his political rivals. Scores of arrests of opposition activists followed the country&#8217;s elections – but Shamir wrote a piece painting an idyllic picture of free, fair, elections in a happy country&#8230;&#8203;  I attempted to leave the organisation early. This was refused. I was cornered for several days and asked to sign a gagging agreement. Supporters were asked to "apply psychological pressure" to encourage me to sign, evidencing a growing cultlike ethos at the centre of the group&#8230;&#8203; The final straw for me came on Friday. By drawing attention to, and then publishing in full, the unredacted cache of documents, WikiLeaks has done the cause of internet freedom – and of whistleblowers – more harm than US government crackdowns ever could.</p>

"Our previous dealings with WikiLeaks were on the clear basis that we would only publish cables which had been subjected to a thorough joint editing and clearance process. We will continue to defend our previous collaborative publishing endeavour. We cannot defend the needless publication of the complete data – indeed, we are united in condemning it.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"In May 2009 I stayed at Mr. Domscheit-Berg’s home in Wiesbaden, Germany for a week while I was visiting a research center located a few hours from his home. On arriving at Mr. Domscheit-Berg’s home, Mr. Assange had just left. Mr. Domscheit-Berg explained to me that he had only asked Mr. Assange to leave because there was not enough space for all three of us to stay in his home. During my stay, he told me that he had had a great time with Mr. Assange. He even went so far as to say it was the best time of his life. It was clear to me that he had very much enjoyed Mr. Assange’s company. He was full of admiration for Mr. Assange, saying what a pleasure it was to talk to him and that he could listen him for hours. For example, he described the time they spent in Italy, at the journalism conference in Peruggia, giving interviews and spending time with Italian colleagues as “a wonderful time”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before leaving I gave WikiLeaks some documents detailing proof of torture and government abuse of a Latin America country. The documents were only in hard copy. I entrusted those valuable documents – the only copy available – to Wikileaks because of the expertise of the people running it, their procedures and the mechanisms they used to maximize impact when published. I did not intend to give such material to Mr. Domscheit-Berg personally, as was made clear to him by me at the time. My intention was to give it to the platform I trusted and contributed to; to WikiLeaks. The material has not been published and I am disturbed to read public statements by Mr. Domscheit-Berg in which he states that he has not returned such documents to WikiLeaks.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mr. Domscheit-Berg and I stayed in touch, he invited me to his wedding in mid 2010 but I was unable to attend. After his wedding, I noticed that his enthusiasm, his interest and priorities regarding WikiLeaks changed significantly. "</p>

<p>In the directory, date-stamped 9 June 2010, were 4 files, all encoded with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encoding, the files names with *.gpg suffixes. I started at the bottom of the list, putting in the David Leigh password. It unzipped z.gpg into a file called z.7z. Opening that file and extracting it using the Ez7z compression / decompression program, the file spat out a file called cables.csv, dated with a creation date of April 12, 2010 at 9:22PM. It was a 1.61GB file but it had been reported in the German press to be 1.73GB.</p>

<pre>January 18, 2011, after Manning had an altercation with the guards, the commander of Quantico classified her as a suicide risk.[179] Manning said the guards had begun issuing conflicting commands, such as "turn left, don't turn left," and upbraiding her for responding to commands with "yes" instead of "aye". Shortly afterward, she was placed on suicide watch, had her clothing and eyeglasses removed, and was required to remain in her cell 24 hours a day. The suicide watch was lifted on January 21 after a complaint from her lawyer, and the brig commander who ordered it was replaced.[180] On March 2, she was told that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things sleeping wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, if she wanted to harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.[181]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The detention conditions prompted national and international concern. Juan E. Méndez, United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, told The Guardian that the U.S. government&#8217;s treatment of Manning was "cruel, inhuman and degrading".[182] In January 2011 Amnesty International asked the British government to intervene because of Manning&#8217;s status as a British citizen by descent, although Manning&#8217;s lawyer said Manning did not regard herself as a British citizen.[183] On March 10, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley criticized Manning&#8217;s treatment as "ridiculous, counterproductive and stupid".[184] The following day, President Obama responded to Crowley&#8217;s comments, saying the Pentagon had assured him that Manning&#8217;s treatment was "appropriate and meet[s] our basic standards". Under political pressure, Crowley resigned three days after his comments.[185] On March 15, 295 members of the academic legal community signed a statement arguing that Manning was being subjected to "degrading and inhumane pretrial punishment" and criticizing Obama&#8217;s comments.[186] On April 20 the Pentagon transferred Manning to the medium-custody Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she was placed in an 80-square-foot cell with a window and a normal mattress, able to mix with other pretrial detainees and keep personal objects in her cell.[187]
Evidence presented at Article 32 hearing
In April 2011, a panel of experts, having completed a medical and mental evaluation of Manning, ruled that she was fit to stand trial.[188] An Article 32 hearing, presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza, was convened on December 16, 2011, at Fort Meade, Maryland; the hearing resulted in Almanza&#8217;s recommending that Manning be referred to a general court-martial. She was arraigned on February 23, 2012, and declined to enter a plea.</p>
