<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On his second day in office, 22 January 2009, US President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison gulag within a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can say, without exception or without equivocation, that America will not torture.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten years later, Guantanamo Bay was still open, the head of the CIA was a woman nicknamed "Bloody Gina" for her role in torturing prisoners, and the only person Obama ever prosecuted for the CIA&#8217;s torture program was the former agent who revealed it in December 2007, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180316140152/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/i-went-to-prison-for-disclosing-the-cias-torture-gina-haspel-helped-cover-it-up/2018/03/15/9507884e-27f8-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html">John Kiriakou</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 27 February 2009, Obama told a cheering crowd of US Marines in North Carolina:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the official end of "combat operations" just signalled a new phase in the war. 50,000 troops remained to train Iraqis to do the same job they were doing: protecting the oil wells and the unpopular US-backed government.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obama&#8217;s vacuous promises won the approval of many who should have known better. On 9 October 2009 he was <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/press-release/">awarded</a> the Nobel Peace Prize. Committee members later <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34277960">admitted</a> it was their worst decision ever. Obama&#8217;s embarrassed staff asked if he could skip the official ceremony in Oslo.</p>

<h3 id="_counterinsurgency">Counterinsurgency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 28 January 2009 WikiLeaks <a href="https://theworldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/wiki/Counterinsurgency">released</a> "thousands of pages of active insurgency and counterinsurgency doctrine from the US, UK and Indian military". This was a compilation of dozens of documents, some previously released and some just released a day earlier, with a common theme of counterinsurgency. The documents detailed not only "how to overtly or covertly supress insurgencies or popular revolts" but also the reverse: "how to infiltrate a country, and stoke an insurgency to overthrow a foreign government".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Highlighting numerous quotes from the US Special Forces doctrines, the release pushed back against recent media coverage where US hawks had sought to define "an expanded role for the US forces, and of course themselves".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Journalists should remember that documents designed to be public, such as the so-called "Petraeus doctrine" published by Chicago University Press in 2007, and publicly promoted by the Pentagon, are sanitized and should be preferentially ignored lest journalists find themselves pushing propaganda onto an unsuspecting public.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three months later, WikiLeaks published the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/US_Army:_Tactics_in_Counterinsurgency,_FMI_3-24.2,_Mar_2009">March 2009 US Army counterinsurgency manual</a>, which was "removed from the US Army&#8217;s website for unknown reasons within a few weeks of its release". In 2014 WikiLeaks also published a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/cia-hvt-counterinsurgency/WikiLeaks_Secret_CIA_review_of_HVT_Operations.pdf">CIA Best Practices in Counterinsurgency</a> document, dated July 2009.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The  document, which is "pro-assassination", was completed in July 2009 and coincides with the first year of the Obama administration and  Leon Panetta&#8217;s directorship of the CIA during which the United States very significantly increased its CIA assassination program at the expense of capture operations.</p>

<p>On the same day, 28 January 2009, WikiLeaks released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/86_interceptaciones_telefonicas_a_politicos_y_autoridades_peruanos,_m%C3%A1s_del_caso_Petrogate,_transcripci%C3%B3nes,_2008">86 intercepted telephone recordings</a> of Peruvian politicians and businessmen who were involved in Peru&#8217;s long-running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Peru_oil_scandal">Petrogate</a> oil scandal. The recordings were released online after being handed to a judge in Lima.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the government of Jorge de Castillo had already resigned over the scandal in October 2008, the new recordings <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Nuevos_audios_ilegales_quedan_en_poder_de_juez_Anticorrupci%C3%B3n">showed</a> the scandal was broader than suspected, with new names involved.

<h3 id="_hello_wikileaks">Hello @wikileaks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks joined Twitter in October 2008 but apparently didn&#8217;t start tweeting till 2009. Twitter became a major communication platform for the organisation and another key to their enduring popular success. Ten years later, after more than fifty thousand tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks">@wikileaks</a> had over 5.5 million followers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1200091642">first tweet</a> from @wikileaks on February 11 2009 got straight down to business:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="2009tweet.png" alt="WikiLeaks first tweet">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tweet linked to a <a href="http://www.bangornews.com/detail/99263.html">news story</a> that had been <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Parts_for_%27dirty_bomb%27_found_in_slain_US_man%27s_home">copied</a> to the wikileaks.org website: "Parts for 'dirty bomb' found in slain US man&#8217;s home".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks page also linked to a source document which was available to download: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Washington_DC_Regional_Threat_and_Analysis_Center_report_re_Inauguration,_16_Jan_2009">Washington DC Regional Threat and Analysis Center report re Inauguration, 16 Jan 2009</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With many of the world&#8217;s journalists and politicians online, and even with the original 140 character limitation, Twitter was obviously a great way for WikiLeaks to quickly communicate with the public. In April 2010 WikiLeaks also created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wikileaks">Facebook page</a>, which ten years later had over 3.6 million likes.</p>

<h3 id="_congressional_research_service_reports">Congressional Research Service Reports</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 8 February 2009 WikiLeaks released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Change_you_can_download:_a_billion_in_secret_Congressional_reports">Change You Can Download</a>: "nearly a billion dollars worth of quasi-secret reports commissioned by the United States Congress".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The taxpayer-funded reports were produced by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) but almost always remained secret unless a politician wanted to exploit them for political purposes. Despite calls from many quarters for over a decade to make their publication fully public, CRS reports were available only to members of Congress, Congressional committees and select sister agencies such as the GAO. WikiLeaks said a grey market had formed around the documents:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Opportunists smuggle out nearly all reports and sell them to cashed up special interests&#8212;&#8203;lobbyists, law firms, multi-nationals, and presumably, foreign governments.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks said that most of the reports had not been seen before:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have sent the reports to <a href="http://opencrs.com">OpenCRS</a>, a great service run by the Center for Democracy and Technology which collects released CRS reports. Of the 6,731 reports we sent to OpenCRS, 6,284 were new to the OpenCRS collection.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenCRS website no longer <a href="https://twitter.com/opencrs/status/520340857455910912?s=20">exists</a>. But nine years after the WikiLeaks release, with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151104200836/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/10/29/a-confidential-arm-of-congress-gets-more-secretive/">help</a> of <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/about.html">many</a> other activists, most CRS reports were made publicly available. Congress still has access to all reports via www.crs.gov but as of 18 September 2018, non-confidential reports are publicly available at crsreports.congress.gov.</p>
</div>

<p>On 12 February 2009 WikiLeaks <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/ISAF:_Afghanistan_civilian_deaths_rises_and_other_statistics,_14_Jan_2009">published</a> an unseen NATO report, dated 14 Jan 2009, showing that civilians casualties in Afghanistan had jumped 46% in the previous year. The report included 12 slides with detailed maps, graphs and statistics.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The report shows a dramatic escalation of the war and civil disorder. Coalition deaths increased by 35%, assassinations and kidnappings by 50% and attacks on the Kabul based Government of Hamid Karzai also more than doubled, rising a massive 119%.</p>
</div>

<div class="quoteblock">

<p>WikiLeaks "legal spokesman Jay Lim" noted that a British Army Colonel had recently been arrested for passing civilian death toll figures to Human Rights Watch.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Marked "For Official Use Only" the study was only distributed to a select group of Coalition war partners, plus Israel. It showed wisespread pessimism about combat operations in both countries, and a clear lack of confidence in the intelligence provided by the CIA, local militia or other sources. RAND said intelligence was not being properly shared, indicators of "success" were not meaningful, and once again civilian concerns were being ignored:</p>

At the time, Coleman was still contesting his loss to comedian Al Franken in a 2008 Minnesota election that was riddled with corruption allegations. Apparently an I.T. consultant found a 4.3 Gigabyte database that was <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2531922/former-minnesota-sen&#8212;&#8203;norm-coleman-s-donor-database-exposed-on-wikileaks.html">sitting unprotected</a> in a public directory on the Coleman campaign&#8217;s website.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the donations list contained credit card numbers, security numbers and personal details, Wikileaks explained that they had only released "the last 4 digits and the security numbers&#8230;&#8203; after notifying those concerned". WikiLeaks published the letter they had sent to donors, along with a letter from their source with links proving that the data was improperly exposed by Norm Coleman&#8217;s own staff. The source also noted that credit card security numbers should never be stored, and the Coleman campaign had broken Minnesota law by failing to report the leak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_Big_Bad_Database_of_Senator_Norm_Coleman">explained</a> that the material had been "floating around" the Internet for at least six weeks but the Coleman campaign had ignored people who tried to raise the issue.

<p>Norm Coleman&#8217;s term as Senator expired on 3 January 2009 but it was not until until 13 April 2009 that Al Franken was declared the winner (by a mere 312 votes).

In December 2010, Coleman published an <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/norm-coleman-obama-must-move-against-wikileaks-now/">angry article</a> in the Washington Examiner encouraging President Obama to "throw the book at Assange."</p>

<p>On 30 July 2009 WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Financial_collapse:_Confidential_exposure_analysis_of_205_companies_each_owing_above_EUR45M_to_Icelandic_bank_Kaupthing,_26_Sep_2008">published</a> a confidential report from Iceland&#8217;s Kaupthing bank, with analysis of 205 companies each owing from 45 million to 1.25 billion euros to the bank. The report was dated 26 September 2008, just days before the bank collapsed. It showed that many of the bank&#8217;s loans were to insiders and unsecured: the highest loans were given to companies connected to just six clients, four of whom were major Kaupthing shareholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 1 August 2009 Iceland&#8217;s national broadcaster RÚV received an injunction just five minutes before their evening news went to air, so they showed a link to the WikiLeaks release page instead. One of the RÚV journalists working on that story was Kristinn Hrafnsson, who had previouly been sacked by an Iceland television station after his programme Kompás investigated Kaupthing Bank. Hrafnsson, who was named Journalist Of The Year three times by Iceland&#8217;s national journalists union, later became a key WikiLeaks staff member.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile WikiLeaks also received a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Icelandic_bank_Kaupthing_threat_to_WikiLeaks_over_confidential_large_exposure_report,_31_Jul_2009">legal threat</a> from Kaupthing&#8217;s lawyers, to which they replied: "We will not assist the remains of Kaupthing, or its clients, to hide its dirty laundry from the global community."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaked report eventually lead to "hundreds of newspaper articles worldwide" and bolstered claims of criminally irresponsible lending. On 4 December 2009 WikiLeaks also published <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/SMS_messages_to_former_Kaupthing_owner_Finnur_Ing%C3%B3lfsson,_2009">SMS messages</a> from an Icelandic businessman to Kaupthing bank&#8217;s former owner. On 9 December 2009, Kaupthing bank&#8217;s former asset manager and former stock broker were each sentenced to eight months prison.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2006, seventeen people died, thirty thousand were injured, and a hundred thousand sought medical help after toxic chemicals were dumped at a dozen sites around the Ivory Coast port of Abidjan. The waste came from a ship named the Probo Koala, chartered by multinational trading company Trafigura, which had been turned away by several countries after Trifagura refused to pay disposal fees in Amsterdam. Trifagura claimed the waste was only "slops" from cleaning the boat&#8217;s tanks, but a Dutch inquiry later found the waste was a toxic mix of fuel, hydrogen sulfide, and sodium hydroxide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 14 September 2009 WikiLeaks published the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Minton_report:_Trafigura_toxic_dumping_along_the_Ivory_Coast_broke_EU_regulations,_14_Sep_2006">Minton Report</a>, an 8-page internal investigation into the spill, commissioned by Trifagura in September 2006, which revealed the waste compounds on the ship were "capable of causing severe human health effects [including] headaches, breathing difficulties, nausea, eye irritation, skin ulceration, unconsciousness and death".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The British media did not report this important leak because three days earlier, on 11 September 2009, Trifagura lawyers got an injunction which not only gagged media coverage of the report, or its contents, but also made it illegal to disclose the existence of the injunction itself. WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Minton_report_secret_injunction_gagging_The_Guardian_on_Trafigura,_11_Sep_2009">published</a> this "super-injunction" after it was leaked by a reporter at Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation NRK, who Trifagura was also <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Trafigura_threats_to_Norwegian_press_over_Minton_report_exposing_toxic_dumping,_Sep_2009">threatening</a> with legal action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 12 October 2009 the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament">reported</a> that they were being banned from covering parliament.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s published Commons order papers contain a question to be answered by a minister later this week. The Guardian is prevented from identifying the MP who has asked the question, what the question is, which minister might answer it, or where the question is to be found.</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented – for the first time in memory – from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This created a public outcry on Twitter and it was soon revealed that Labour MP Paul Farrelly, a former editor of the Observer, was planning to ask a question about the Guardian being gagged, thus revealing the existence of the super-injunction under Parliamentary privilege.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julian Assange <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast_toxic_dumping_report_behind_secret_Guardian_gag">said</a> it was extraordinary that Trafigura&#8217;s lawyers felt they could silence reporting of parliament.

<p>WikiLeaks also published an <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_Independent:_Toxic_Shame:_Thousands_injured_in_African_city,_17_Sep_2009">investigation</a> from the Independent newspaper, titled "Toxic Shame" and dated 17 September, which had no mention of the Minton report and was taken offline without explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, shortly before a court showdown with UK media organisations, Trifigura&#8217;s lawyers bowed to public pressure and allowed reporting of the MP&#8217;s question. But the media was still not allowed to report on the Minton report, or its contents, or its location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/13/trafigura-drops-gag-guardian-oil">not impressed</a>.</p>

<p>On 15 October WikiLeaks posted an update on their original release page, encouraging readers to share their link:</p>

<p>Until December 2009 the BBC was locked in a legal battle with Trifagura, but it conceded defeat and settled out of court amid reports that the case could cost up to 3 million pounds. WikiLeaks re-published a slew of articles and news programs that were taken down:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 21 November 2009 WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_emails,_data,_models,_1996-2009">published</a> over 60MB of emails, documents, code and models from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. The material, written between 1996 and 2009, was posted on a Russian server by a hacker a few days earlier and mirrored on several other sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The release triggered a worldwide debate about climate science, with the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit just weeks away. Climate change denialists hand-picked certain phrases, often totally out of context, and claimed they were hard proof that man-made global warming was a scientific hoax. For example, one email using the words "hide the decline" was cited by denialists, including US Senator Jim Inhofe and former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, as proof of a cover up. In fact it was referring to a "decline" in data from tree-ring analyses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examination by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219051546/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/feb/05/cru-climate-change-hacker">Guardian</a> showed the hacker had filtered data by searching for certain key words and almost all the emails were related to only four climatologists.  An editorial in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Natur.462..545.">Nature magazine</a> concluded "A fair reading of the e-mails reveals nothing to support the denialists' conspiracy theories." Numerous inquiries were conducted: the hacker was never found but the CRU and the scientists involved were absolved of any misconduct, aside from some rude language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the "Climategate" debate was raging online and in the media, the World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Decade/climate-2009-caps-hottest-decade-record/story?id=9283733">announced</a> that the decade ending on 31 December 2009 would likely be the warmest on record, and 2009 was set to be the fifth warmest year ever recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 9 December 2009 WikiLeaks published a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Draft_Copenhagen_climate_change_agreement,_8_Dec_2009">draft version</a> of the Copenhagen climate change agreement, which nations at the climate summit were still working to finalise. This early draft version, dubbed the "Dutch Text", was authored by nations in a "circle of commitment" including the UK, US and Denmark. They planned to abandon the Kyoto Protocol, sideline the United Nations, and hand control of climate change finance to the World Bank. Rich nations would be allowed almost twice as much carbon emissions per capita than poorer nations. The released draft caused an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/08/copenhagen-climate-summit-disarray-danish-text">uproar</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The messages were sent to private sector and unclassified military pagers, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Egads!_Confidential_9/11_Pager_Messages_Disclosed">apparently</a> through the networks of Arch Wireless, Metrocall, Skytel, and Weblink Wireless.

<p>One string of messages hints at how federal agencies scrambled to evacuate to Mount Weather, the government&#8217;s sort-of secret bunker buried under the Virginia mountains west of Washington, D.C.

That&#8217;s the phone number for the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#8217;s National Continuity Programs Directorate&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is charged with "the preservation of our constitutional form of government at all times," even during a nuclear war.

<p>9/11 conspiracy theorists were disappointed that the pager data did not provide evidence to challenge the official narrative.

<p>We have lots of very significant upcoming releases, significant in terms of bandwidth, but even more significant in terms of amount of labour they will require to process and in terms of legal attacks we will get. So we need to be in a stronger position before we can publish the material.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said "probably five people" were working full-time on WikiLeaks, without drawing a salary, while another 800 "do it occasionally throughout the year". He estimated that WikiLeaks needed about $200,000 per year to operate, but it would be more like $600,000 if everyone was paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Media organisations like AP, Los Angeles Times, and The National Newspaper Association were listed on the website as “steadfast supporters” because they donated lawyers' time, not cash (WikiLeaks does not accept donations from corporations or governments).</p>

<p>On 7 January 2010 WikiLeaks <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/7465743046?s=20">tweeted</a> that the site would "remain down to concentrate on fundraising".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the Chaos Computer Club convention in December 2009, Julian Assange <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/303_l4613_Wikileaks_Panel">appeared</a> on a discussion panel about censorship. He said WikiLeaks had started out expecting the least developed nations, with the most blatant censorship, to benefit most from WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But censorship is a global problem. Censorship is in fact, at a technological level, lead by the West.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He said every form of media was now moving onto the Internet, which meant it was all increasingly subject to Internet censorship. He cited the UK&#8217;s "secret courts" forcing news stories offline, and the secret government censorship lists, revealed by WikiLeaks, as examples of such technological censorship.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is this happening now, between governments? Why are they responding in the same way?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said the Internet was an increasingly important target, politically and economically, for vested powers in various countries that were "moving together to try and take control of something that threatens their interests". He said the European Union and other globalised trading agreements showed nations uniting to create new legal standards, including agreements on Internet censorship, which potentially threatened WikiLeaks' publishing model. WikiLeaks was currently "protected somewhat by placing our information in different states, by playing one state off against another". But for how much longer?</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is the new standard for publishing freedoms? What is the new standard for communication?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Would the new legal standard be that "of the most free country, or the least free country"?</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have an opportunity to push that standard to be the union of press protection freedoms, the union of whistle-blower freedoms, and the union of communication freedoms, not their intersection.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An audience member asked why many journalists were so willing to support censorship. Assange said it was largely due to competition, with old establishment media seeing online news sites as financial competition.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mainstream media have to act like the good guys in order to be tolerated by readers.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his final comments, Assange warned that it was important to establish good standards while there was still time.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traditional media won many legal protections for publishing. It managed to do that through its power as an industry. As they lose their monopoly, competing with bloggers that have no union behind them, I think we&#8217;ll see a state where there is no journalistic force as a powerful industry to keep up those protections. So we need to set the standard now, while we still have the remnants of a powerful media industry. Because pretty soon it&#8217;s not gonna be there. There&#8217;ll be distribution industries but there won&#8217;t be journalistic industries.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ­October 2009, a US Army Private named Bradley Manning arrived at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oh9i27Ky9I">Forward ­Operating Base Hammer</a>, 40 miles from Baghdad, Iraq. Manning&#8217;s superiors had debated whether the 21-year-old from Oklahoma, who took six months to complete Basic Training (usually a ten week course) and had been referred to an Army mental health counselor just two months earlier, would be a safety risk in Iraq. But intelligence analysts were in high demand and Manning was good at the job.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In November 2009, Private First Class Manning was promoted to Specialist, with top security access to SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same month, Manning <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/">contacted</a> an online gender counselor back in the States.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning also told the counselor about a targeting mission in Basra that had not gone to plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Two groups of locals were converging in this one area. Manning was trying to figure out why they were meeting,” the counselor told me. On Manning’s information, the Army moved swiftly, ­dispatching a unit to hunt them down. Manning had thought all went well, until a superior explained the outcome. “Ultimately, some guy loosely connected to the group got killed,” the counselor said. To the counselor, it was clear: Manning felt that there was blood on his hands. “He was very, very distressed.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>About that time, Manning later ­explained, “everything started slipping.” Manning, it turned out, wasn’t built for this kind of war. “i was a <strong>part</strong> of something … i was actively involved in something that i was completely against.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to her later <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_zC44SBaZPoQmJUYURBUnBycUk/edit">testimony</a>, Manning had been "vaguely aware" of WikiLeaks since 2008 but did not "fully pay attention" until the 9/11 pager messages were released. She was curious about how WikiLeaks got hold of sensitive military documents, some of which she found "useful in my work as an analyst". She soon became active in online chats about "the WikiLeaks Organisation" (WLO).</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I conducted searches on both NIPRnet and SIPRnet on WLO beginning in late November 2009 and early December 2009. At this time I also began to routinely monitor the WLO website.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In response to one of my searches in December 2009, I found the U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence Centre (USACIC) report on WLO&#8230;&#8203;  I discovered information that contradicted the 2008 USACIC report, including information indicating that, similar to other press agencies, WLO seemed to be dedicated to exposing illegal activities and corruption. WLO received numerous awards and recognition for its reporting activities.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following weeks, Manning began smuggling a huge trove of sensitive data out of the US Army computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>

<p>“I would come in with music on a CD-RW labelled with something like Lady Gaga erase the music then write a compressed split file.
