<p>On 24 November 2010 the Pentagon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101129222501/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-24/pentagon-warns-house-senate-defense-panels-of-more-wikileaks-documents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> the US Senate and House Armed Services Committees that WikiLeaks and its media partners were preparing to release "several hundred thousand” classified US State Department cables in the next few days. A spokeswoman called it "an irresponsible attempt to wreak havoc and destabilize global security". WikiLeaks accused the Pentagon of "<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikileaks/status/7318451311869952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperventilating</a>".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The New York Times had already shared the leaked Cablegate archive with the US State Department, which was now busy preparing allied governments for the impact of the disclosures. On 26 November 2010, the US Ambassador <a href="http://twitter.com/<mark>!/wikileaks/status/7955258869288960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visited</a> 10 Downing Street in London, while Hillary Clinton <a href="http://twitter.com/</mark>!/wikileaks/status/7955759623053312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">briefed</a> Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd. WikiLeaks tweeted that US officials were also contacting government ministers in Canada, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Iraq, Turkey, Russia and Iceland. They all knew what was coming.</p>

<p>Assange was angry at the Guardian for leaking the cables to the New York Times, and angry at the Times for contacting the US State Department, but he also took the opportunity - perhaps as a protective measure - to offer the US State Department a final opportunity to specify any cables that would endanger lives. On 26 November he personally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/documents/letters-between-wikileaks-and-gov#text/p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to the US Ambassador in London:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject to the general objective of ensuring maximum disclosure of information in the public interest, WikiLeaks would be grateful for the United States Government to privately nominate any specific instances (record numbers or names) where it considers the publication of information would put individual persons at significant risk of harm that has not already been addressed. WikiLeaks will respect the confidentiality of advice provided by the United States Government and is prepared to consider any such submissions made without delay.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The private offer was publicly declined, with a US legal adviser&#8217;s response released to the media on the following day:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government classified materials.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A press release from the White House, just hours before the Cablegate release, insisted that the disclosures would put at risk US "diplomats, intelligence professionals, and people around the world who come to the United States for assistance in promoting democracy and open government."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>President Obama supports responsible, accountable, and open government at home and around the world, but this reckless and dangerous action runs counter to that goal. By releasing stolen and classified documents, Wikileaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange responded by email that WikiLeaks had "absolutely no desire to put individual persons at significant risk of harm, nor do we wish to harm the national security of the United States". He lamented that the US government had rejected his offer for "constructive dialogue and chosen a confrontational approach".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand that the United States government would prefer not to have the information that will be published in the public domain and is not in favour of openness. That said, either there is a risk or there is not. You have chosen to respond in a manner which leads me to conclude that the supposed risks are entirely fanciful and you are instead concerned to suppress evidence of human rights abuse and other criminal behaviour. We will now proceed to release the material subject to our checks and the checks of our media partners unless you get back to me, as you promised in the call with our lawyers last Friday.</p>

<p>As usual, the much-hyped threats to human lives never materialised. By the time the cables were published, the US State Department had had weeks to prepare for the impact. Even allied governments were prepared.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As over two hundred and fifty thousand documents from the US State Department began spilling into the public domain on 28 November 2010, there was no initial release from WikiLeaks, not even a press conference. The media partners posted their reports, describing explosive secrets from countries all around the world, while WikiLeaks merely published the corresponding diplomatic cables. Assange was keeping a low profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Articles based on the first 220 files were published by El País (Spain), Der Spiegel (Germany), Le Monde (France), The Guardian (United Kingdom) and The New York Times (United States). The material was to be published over a period of several weeks, with other global media organisations gradually involved, thus maximising impact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After months of work, New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager was "lucky enough" to be with the WikiLeaks team at a secret location "somewhere outside London" when the first cables were released. He said he "had a feeling of being present as history was being made". Then the WikiLeaks website came under attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first bundle of documents went live at 6pm British time and immediately there was a massive denial of service attack. Unknown people somewhere in the world were bombarding the WikiLeaks' websites, trying to close them down.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everything was focused on a computer specialist who had arrived at the house to donate his time to overseeing the launch. He was obviously at the top of his profession. Everyone seemed in awe of his skills. He had prepared for the launch, typing computer code faster than most journalists can write words, apparently working straight through the night. Now he was engrossed in fending off the cyber attack: monitoring the waves of incoming traffic and identifying and blocking the attackers. The mood was tense until, after a long 30 minutes, he looked up with a little smile and said the attack seemed to be over.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks continued fighting off similar attacks for several days. Despite all the stress, Julian Assange was in a bouyant mood.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working in that crowded room, he was very focused, but also good humoured and thoughtful of others. For someone at the centre of international news attention, and an international man-hunt, he seemed calm and considered, and not to be taking himself too seriously. He is clearly the central force in the organisation, but there were gutsy people working around him as well. Sometimes they sought his decisions on things and other times they bossed him around.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaked cables, dated from 1966 to February 2010, disclosed confidential communications between the State Department in Washington DC and 274 US embassies around the world. 15,652 of the cables were classified "secret", with another 101,748 "confidential" and 133,887 "unclassified". A WikiLeaks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101128231513/http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/">press release</a> said the cables would give people around the world "an unprecedented insight into US Government foreign activities".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cables show the extent of US spying on its allies and the UN; turning a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in "client states"; backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries; lobbying for US corporations; and the measures US diplomats take to advance those who have access to them.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document release reveals the contradictions between the US’s public persona and what it says behind closed doors – and shows that if citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes, they should ask to see what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian&#8217;s first big story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cables-spying-un" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had ordered her staff to spy on top United Nations officials, including the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, and the Permanent Security Council representatives from China, Russia, France and the UK. Washington wanted biometric data including "DNA, fingerprints and iris scans", along with "credit card numbers, email addresses, phone, fax and pager numbers and even frequent-flyer account numbers". This was a clear breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention, which covers the UN. Another cable revealed that this spying was done at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/wikileaks-cables-cia-united-nations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behest</a> of the CIA. In an interview with Time magazine, Julian Assange called for Hillary Clinton to resign:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"She should resign, if it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering US diplomatic figures to engage in espionage in the United Nations, in violation of the international covenants to which the US has signed up. Yes, she should resign over that."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101210082836/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5igLhpFXyv-VRG5thAgiJk0OORBNw?docId=CNG.7936abe2aac85ef50ca11a2d6b6c031b.dc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that President Obama should also resign, if he had approved the spying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210518041802/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29spy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that US and British diplomats also spied on UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in the weeks before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Annan declared "illegal". State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley blithely dismissed public shock at these revelations.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"This is what diplomats, from our country and other countries, have done for hundreds of years.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>US officials claimed that most of the cables only revealed diplomats hard at work, often doing good things like putting pressure on the Saudi government to let women drive cars. As usual, the latest WikiLeaks release was simultanously "recklessly dangerous" and "putting lives at risk" but also "nothing to see here".</p>
</div>

<p>Citizens around the world, however, were shocked by what they discovered. For example: the USA had <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/11/09BERLIN1433.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear weapons</a> in Denmark; European allies were ready to quit the war in Afghanistan; the USA had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-us-manipulated-climate-accord" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliberately undermined</a> the UN&#8217;s 2009 global climate summit in Copenhagen; the USA sought to derail delivery of subsidised Venezuelan petroleum in order to protect the business interests of US oil companies; US companies pressured the government to block an increase in Haiti&#8217;s minimum wage. In Mexico, the US ambassador <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/20/us-ambassador-mexico-resigns-wikileaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned</a> after a leaked cable revealed his complaints about government handling of the war on drug cartels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Tunisia, a cable from the US Ambassador <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-tunisia-first-lady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that President Ben Ali and his regime had "lost touch with the Tunisian people" and were "relying on the police" to cling to power.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Corruption in the inner circle is growing. Even average Tunisians are now keenly aware of it, and the chorus of complaints is rising. Tunisians intensely dislike, even hate, first lady Leila Trabelsi and her family. In private, regime opponents mock her; even those close to the government express dismay at her reported behaviour. Meanwhile, anger is growing at Tunisia&#8217;s high unemployment and regional inequities. As a consequence, the risks to the regime&#8217;s long-term stability are increasing.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten days after this news was reported, a Tunisian market stall holder named Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, sparking local riots that spread and eventually triggered "Arab Spring" revolutions across the Middle East. Many of the protestors cited WikiLeaks revelations as conclusive evidence of long-suspected corruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A blogger at <a href="http://www.arabist.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Arabist</a> suggested that the Cablegate leaks had particular impact in the Arab world, where media criticism of the US government was seldom tolerated despite wisespread public cynicism. Pakistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations were especially impacted by the cables, with neighbouring Iraq and Afghanista among the most discussed topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaked cables lead to hundreds of stories around the world (well beyond the scope of this book) and an avalance of diplomatic fallout which continued for many years. Even a decade later, old US cables were still being produced as evidence whenever cited events, facts and public figures became newsworthy.  The cables were eventually merged into WikiLeaks' searchable "Plus D" <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/plusd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Library of US Diplomacy</a>.</p>

<p>Despite writing to Europol, Interpol, and British authorities, none of the "various arrest warrants" were provided to them. Assange&#8217;s lawyers said they were not provided with any evidence from Sweden or even an allegation in English.</p>

<p>The letter, which was released to the press, begins: "Dear Ms Robinson and Mr Assange. I am writing in response to your 26 November 2010 letter to US Ambassador Louis B Susman regarding your intention to again publish on your WikiLeaks site what you claim to be classified US government documents." Robinson said: "By eliding client and lawyer, that was a very inappropriate attempt to implicate me. That is really inappropriate to come from the State Department of all places; they understand very well the rules on attorney-client protocol."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s lawyers were negotiating a date for him to appear before a court and negotiate bail. Publicly, they refused to even confirm that the WikiLeaks founder was still in Britain. But after media reported that he was "in hiding", Kristinn Hrafnsson explained: “he is not in hiding, the authorities here, the police know where he is." The Guardian reported that Assange was "seeking supporters to put up surety" and "expected to have to post bail of between £100,000 and £200,000".</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am an Australian citizen and I miss my country a great deal. However, during the last weeks the Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, and the attorney general, Robert McClelland, have made it clear that not only is my return is impossible but that they are actively working to assist the United States government in its attacks on myself and our people. This brings into question what does it mean to be an Australian citizen - does that mean anything at all? Or are we all to be treated like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Hicks</a> at the first possible opportunity merely so that Australian politicians and diplomats can be invited to the best US embassy cocktail parties.</p>

They said: "the WikiLeaks case is unprecedented both in its scale and nature". Two weeks later the embassy advised Canberra that media reports of a secret WikiLeaks grand jury were "likely true". In spite of this, Australian government officials publicly pretended for over eight years that Assange&#8217;s extradition case was just about the Swedish sex allegations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the two prosecutors attached to the WikiLeaks Grand Jury was US attorney Neil McBride, who was forced to <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/08/23/us-attorney-neil-mcbride-to-step-down-amid-probes-into-mcdonnell-and-wikileaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resign</a> from his "dream job" just three years later. MacBride was nominated by President Obama to run the Eastern District jurisdiction, which is home to both the Pentagon and the CIA and handles most US "national security" cases. In addition to WikiLeak, MacBride was involved in prosecuting National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Megaupload file-sharing site&#8217;s German founder Kim Dotcom. In the wake of the 2001 terror attacks, McBride made a name for himself by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-vas-eastern-district-us-attorneys-reach-transcends-geographic-bounds/2012/12/15/a3f8f992-4625-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanding</a> extraterritorial applications of US criminal law.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach aligned neatly with the dominant US Neoconservative view that, with the end of the Cold War, the USA was now the sole superpower and thus "<a href="https://www.antiwar.com/orig/lind1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American Century</a>" was just beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Senator Joe Lieberman was also keen to adjust existing laws. On 2 December 2010, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101206214522/http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/news-events/news/2010/12/bipartisan-legislation-goes-after-wikileaks-by-amending-espionage-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a bipartisan plan to amend the 1917 Espionage Act in order “to go after Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange.” John Ensign was one of two Republican Senators who co-signed the plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Julian Assange and his cronies, in their effort to hinder our war efforts, are creating a hit list for our enemies by publishing the names of our human intelligence sources,” said Ensign. “Our sources are bravely risking their lives when they stand up against the tyranny of al-Qaeda, the Taliban and murderous regimes, and I simply will not stand idly by as they become death targets because of Julian Assange. Let me be very clear, WikiLeaks is not a whistleblower website and Assange is not a journalist.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The argument that Assange was not a journalist was widely repeated in the media, implicitly suggesting that the Australian would not receive US First Amendment protections if he was charged under US law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CIA meanwhile <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122104599.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2010122105304n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up</a> a new "WikiLeaks Task Force", whose official acronym W.T.F. was met with much mirth by WikiLeaks supporters. And the Daily Beast reported that the Obama administration was planning "a major reshuffling of diplomats, military officers, and intelligence operatives at US embassies around the world out of concern that WikiLeaks has made it impossible — if not dangerous — for many of the Americans to remain in their current posts”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Journalists who worked with WikiLeaks were also under growing pressure as stories continued appearing. The editors of El Pais wrote a strong <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2010/12/23/inenglish/1293085243_850210.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial</a> defending their decision to publish the cables:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The publication of the diplomatic cables has stirred international opinion and surprised some governments, who often adduce false arguments to downplay or discredit this news bomb. The security of individual sources has been assured by eliminating names and data that might endanger them, as the reader will have noticed. The media that have published the revelations have acted within the limits sketched out by the US Supreme Court in the Pentagon Papers case, opting for freedom of information and the citizen’s right to know. As for the relevance of the information, the pages of this newspaper speak for themselves.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no historical precedent for this in term of scope, as it affects so many conflicts throughout the world. The revelations show a seamy side of the political world, about which we all had well-grounded suspicions, but no clear certainty. We are, in a sense, freer now than we were before, which is as much as journalism can hope to achieve.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, US Air Force staff and other US government employees were blocked from accessing the news websites of El Pais, the Guardian, the New York Times or other news organisations reporting on the WikiLeaks cables. The Wall Street Journal reported on 15 December 2010 that at least 25 sites were barred. Staff who attempted to access them received an on-screen message: "Access denied. Internet usage is logged and monitored."</p>

<p>Aaron Barr was a former Navy SIGINT officer working as CEO for US govt funded security firm HBGary Federal (parent company is the security firm HBGary).

Another slide made clear that the company had expertise in "computer network attack," "custom malware development," and "persistent software implants."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By October 2010, Barr was under considerable stress. His CEO job was under threat, and the e-mails show that the specter of divorce loomed over his personal life. On October 19, a note arrived. HBGary Federal might be able to provide part of "a complete intelligence solution to a law firm that approached us."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was Team Themis partnership with Palantir and a DC-based law firm  Hunton &amp; Williams (Barr then dug up social media shhit on H&amp;W staff to scare them). But it soon became clear what this was about: the US Chamber of Commerce wanted to know if certain groups attacking them were "astroturf" groups funded by the large unions. But before H&amp;W made a decision on Chamber of Commerce plan, it had another urgent request for Team Themis: a major US bank had come to H&amp;W seeking help against WikiLeaks (the bank has been widely assumed to be Bank of America, which has long been rumored to be a future WikiLeaks target.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We want to sell this team as part of what we are talking about," said the team&#8217;s H&amp;W contact. "I need a favor.

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At 7:30am the next morning, Barr had another great idea—find some way to make WikiLeaks supporters like Glenn Greenwald feel like their jobs might be at stake for supporting the organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"One other thing," he wrote in his morning message. "I think we need to highlight people like Glenn Greenwald. Glenn was critical in the Amazon to OVH [data center] transition and helped WikiLeaks provide access to information during the transition. It is this level of support we need to attack. These are established professionals that have a liberal bent, but ultimately most of them if pushed will choose professional preservation over cause, such is the mentality of most business professionals. Without the support of people like Glenn WikiLeaks would fold."</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barr&#8217;s ideas about WikiLeaks went beyond attacks on their infrastructure. He wrote in a separate document that WikiLeaks was having trouble getting money because its payment sources were being blocked. "Also need to get people to understand that if they support the organization we will come after them," he wrote. "Transaction records are easily identifiable."</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In November, when a major US bank wanted a strategy for taking down WikiLeaks, Barr immediately drafted a presentation in which he suggested "cyber attacks against the infrastructure to get data on document submitters.

<p>While waiting to see if his proposals would result in work for HBGary Federal, Barr turned in January to unmask the leadership of the hacker collective Anonymous. This part of the story is well known by now (read our investigative feature): when Barr went public with his findings, Anonymous took down his website, stole his e-mails, deleted the company&#8217;s backup data, trashed Barr&#8217;s Twitter account, and remotely wiped his iPad.</p>

15 dec US air force blocks employees from accessing the websites of the Guardian, the New York Times and other news organisations carrying the WikiLeaks US embassy cables.

They include the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange; Bradley Manning, the alleged army leaker; the Icelandic MP Brigitta Jonsdottir; and the Dutch hacker Rop Gonggrijp. The writ, approved by a court in Virginia in December, covers information including the computers and networks used by the group to communicate.</p>

<p>Assange’s attorney, Stephens, told Al Jazeera that he believed the United States was waiting for Assange to be extradited to Sweden on a different case to make a formal legal move against his client. Assange is currently in custody in London awaiting an extradition hearing in a case involving alleged sex crimes in Sweden. The hearing will be held Tuesday. Stephens said it’s his understanding that if Assange is extradited to Sweden, authorities there plan to “defer their interest in him to the Americans,” essentially taking a backseat to any criminal complaint the United States has against Assange. “It does seem to me that what we have here [in Sweden] is nothing more than a holding charge,” Stephens said. The United States simply wants Assange detained in whatever way possible so that “ultimately they can get their mitts on him,” he said.</p>

<p>Grand Juries were first established by England&#8217;s King Henry II in 1166. The United States is one of only two nations that still utilize the antiquated system (the other being Liberia in Africa). The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:</p>

<pre>"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury ..."</pre>

<p>Neither the targets of a US grand jury nor their lawyers have a right to appear before the grand jury unless they are invited, nor do they have a right to present evidence. In 2009, out of 69,254 US grand jury suspects, only 20 were not indicted. If a grand jury does not indict, the prosecutor can simply impanel a new grand jury. Hence the popular US lawyers joke: "a grand jury could indict a ham sandwich".</p>

<p>Leigh defended Davies on Twitter Monday night, suggesting that The Guardian reporter actually kept out specific details from the police report while publishing what was deemed necessary for the story.

"Nick left out a lot of graphic and damaging material in the allegations because he thought it would be too cruel to publish them," Leigh said by phone. <a href="https://exileonmoanstreet.blogspot.com/2010/12/wikileaks-assange-fires-back-at.html" class="bare">https://exileonmoanstreet.blogspot.com/2010/12/wikileaks-assange-fires-back-at.html</a></p>

In Trevor Fitzgibbon’s case, the sole accusation of rape came from a woman who it eventuated had sent him a slew of nude and semi-nude photos before the alleged incident, and then another text message afterwards to congratulate and praise him for his sexual performance. She then immediately thereafter asked him to do a number of professional favours for her and her clients. Her rape claim was investigated by authorities – who after a year-long inquiry, struck them down as baseless and declined to charge him. He subsequently took the evidence of her duplicity to a court, and successfully sued her for defamation. She has now publicly retracted her allegations against him.</p>

A well-known TV reporter in Reykjavik at the time, Hrafnsson considered Siggi’s leaks to be “quite significant” and worthy of an introduction to another up-and-coming whistle-blower, Julian Assange, who was speaking at the University of Iceland.</p>

<p>JA gave him a burner phone. “There’s a video I want to show you,” Siggi recalls Assange telling him as they sat inside Jónsdóttir’s small house in Reykjavik one wintry night soon after they met in February 2010&#8230;&#8203; Siggi, whom Assange gave the handle PenguinX (he was later known as Q), became his dependable errand boy and confidant: talking regularly, looking for equipment, making encrypted calls to contacts on Assange’s behalf&#8230;&#8203; By October 2010, Assange had appointed Siggi to Snorrason’s old post of running the WikiLeaks chat room.</p>

<p>Assange was on the lookout for FBI agents, informants and betrayers. And there was one unlikely group of people whom he feared might be rallying against him: the Bradley Manning Support Network. In July, Assange had pledged to pay for a substantial amount of Manning’s defense, which was expected to cost more than $100,000, and the group was increasingly angry that, months later, no money had come through. According to Siggi, Assange had simply moved on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout the fall, Siggi was getting word from BMSN co-founder David House that David Coombs, Manning’s attorney, was threatening to go public. “Coombs will go to the media very soon,” House warned Siggi in one chat. “I need someone in WL to do their job and actually start giving a shit about Manning’s defense.”&#8230;&#8203; (After BMSN went public, WL gave $15,000.)</p>

<p>Hrafnsson, he insisted that apart from a trip to Ellingham Hall Siggi “was never traveling on behalf of WikiLeaks anywhere.” But several European journalists I spoke with confirmed their meetings with Siggi who it seems delivered cablegate thumb drives around Europe.</p>

<p>In January 2011, he arrived in Honduras to meet with editors from the newspaper El Heraldo and was greeted by a team of armed bodyguards. When Siggi asked why he needed such heavy security, one of the goons told him, “because you’re white, and you could get stabbed or kidnapped.”</p>

<p>Siggi had Gnosis introduce him to one of the most infamous hackers of all: Sabu, leader of the Anonymous offshoot LulzSec. In the spring of 2011, LulzSec had taken down the sites of high-profile targets including Fox, the CIA and PBS, whose Web page they replaced with the title “FREE BRADLEY MANNING. FUCK FRONTLINE!” But Sabu wanted proof that Siggi was who he said he was by speaking with Assange directly. Siggi claims to have complied and arranged the Skype call.</p>

They wanted to know WikiLeaks’ physical security, their technical security, locations of computer servers, how Assange lived, his daily routine, “literally, everything,” Siggi says. And he had plenty of data to share: several hard drives of WikiLeaks private files that he had amassed during his time with the organization – just in case he ever needed them.</p>

Siggi e-mailed the FBI telling them the news. “No longer with WikiLeaks – so not sure how I can help you more. Sorry I couldn’t do more :(“</p>

<p>To his surprise, the FBI still had more work for him. Shortly after WikiLeaks published the Stratfor files in February 2012, Siggi was flown to Washington, D.C., where he met with members of the CIA, the DOD and the FBI at a Marriott hotel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On March 5th, LulzSec hacker Jeremy Hammond was arrested for hacking the Stratfor files leaked to WikiLeaks (he’d later be sentenced to 10 years in prison). The next day, Kayla, the LulzSec hacker Siggi had conspired with, was indicted on conspiracy charges – and revealed to be a man, 25-year-old Ryan Ackroyd, from England. But the biggest shock came when Siggi read in the news that Sabu was an FBI informant, and had been since June 2011&#8230;&#8203; Sabu had been an informant during the time of the Stratfor and Syria files, that meant something incredible: The FBI had been well aware of the Stratfor and Syria hacks all along, and done nothing to intervene. Their target had always been Assange.</p>

<p>During a meeting in Denmark in March, the FBI had Siggi sign over eight hard drives containing his WikiLeaks files. When Siggi asked them about Sabu, the agents just smiled and gave him $5,000 to cover his cost of living, then sent him on his way. He never heard from them again.</p>

<p>In January 2013, Siggi watched TV in horror as Hrafnsson told a reporter how he had learned the previous summer that the FBI had come to Iceland to secretly interview someone about WikiLeaks – he just didn’t know who it was. But after meeting with Ögmundur Jónasson, who had just left the position of Iceland’s Minister of the Interior, he pieced together that Siggi was the one who had gone to the FBI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I met with Jónasson, who told me how, in June 2011, Iceland received a warning from U.S. authorities of “an imminent attack on Icelandic computer systems.” Two months later, Jónasson found out that a plane full of FBI agents had arrived in Iceland for another purpose: to investigate WikiLeaks. Because they didn’t have authorization for this, he turned them away – only to find out later that they had taken Siggi to Copenhagen. “I still have suspicion,” he says, “that this was part of an attempt to put a case against Julian Assange.”</p>
