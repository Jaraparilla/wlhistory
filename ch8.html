<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 24 November 2010 the Pentagon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101129222501/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-24/pentagon-warns-house-senate-defense-panels-of-more-wikileaks-documents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> the US Senate and House Armed Services Committees that WikiLeaks and its media partners were preparing to release "several hundred thousand” classified US State Department cables in the next few days. A spokeswoman called it "an irresponsible attempt to wreak havoc and destabilize global security". WikiLeaks accused the Pentagon of "<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikileaks/status/7318451311869952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperventilating</a>".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The New York Times had already shared the leaked Cablegate archive with the US State Department, which was now busy preparing allied governments for the impact of the disclosures. On 26 November 2010, the US Ambassador <a href="http://twitter.com/<mark>!/wikileaks/status/7955258869288960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visited</a> 10 Downing Street in London, while Hillary Clinton <a href="http://twitter.com/</mark>!/wikileaks/status/7955759623053312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">briefed</a> Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd. WikiLeaks tweeted that US officials were also contacting government ministers in Canada, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Iraq, Turkey, Russia and Iceland.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange was angry at the Guardian for leaking the cables to the New York Times, and angry at the Times for contacting the US State Department, but he also took the opportunity - perhaps as a protective measure - to offer the US State Department a final opportunity to specify any cables that would endanger lives. On 26 November he personally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/documents/letters-between-wikileaks-and-gov#text/p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to the US Ambassador in London:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject to the general objective of ensuring maximum disclosure of information in the public interest, WikiLeaks would be grateful for the United States Government to privately nominate any specific instances (record numbers or names) where it considers the publication of information would put individual persons at significant risk of harm that has not already been addressed. WikiLeaks will respect the confidentiality of advice provided by the United States Government and is prepared to consider any such submissions made without delay.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The private offer was publicly declined, with a US legal adviser&#8217;s response released to the media on the following day:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government classified materials.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A press release from the White House, just hours before the Cablegate release, insisted that the disclosures would put at risk US "diplomats, intelligence professionals, and people around the world who come to the United States for assistance in promoting democracy and open government."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>President Obama supports responsible, accountable, and open government at home and around the world, but this reckless and dangerous action runs counter to that goal. By releasing stolen and classified documents, Wikileaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange responded by email that WikiLeaks had "absolutely no desire to put individual persons at significant risk of harm, nor do we wish to harm the national security of the United States". He lamented that the US government had rejected his offer for "constructive dialogue and chosen a confrontational approach".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand that the United States government would prefer not to have the information that will be published in the public domain and is not in favour of openness. That said, either there is a risk or there is not. You have chosen to respond in a manner which leads me to conclude that the supposed risks are entirely fanciful and you are instead concerned to suppress evidence of human rights abuse and other criminal behaviour. We will now proceed to release the material subject to our checks and the checks of our media partners unless you get back to me, as you promised in the call with our lawyers last Friday.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As usual, the much-hyped threats to human lives never materialised. By the time the cables were published, the US State Department had had weeks to prepare for the impact. Even allied governments were prepared.</p>

<h3 id="_cablegate">Cablegate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As over two hundred and fifty thousand documents from the US State Department began spilling into the public domain on 28 November 2010, there was no initial release from WikiLeaks, not even a press conference. The media partners posted their reports, describing explosive secrets from countries all around the world, while WikiLeaks merely published the corresponding diplomatic cables. Assange was keeping a low profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Articles based on the first 220 files were published by El País (Spain), Der Spiegel (Germany), Le Monde (France), The Guardian (United Kingdom) and The New York Times (United States). The material was to be published over a period of several weeks, with other global media organisations gradually involved, thus maximising impact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After months of work, New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager was "lucky enough" to be with the WikiLeaks team at a secret location "somewhere outside London" when the first cables were released. He said he "had a feeling of being present as history was being made". Then the WikiLeaks website came under attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first bundle of documents went live at 6pm British time and immediately there was a massive denial of service attack. Unknown people somewhere in the world were bombarding the WikiLeaks' websites, trying to close them down.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everything was focused on a computer specialist who had arrived at the house to donate his time to overseeing the launch. He was obviously at the top of his profession. Everyone seemed in awe of his skills. He had prepared for the launch, typing computer code faster than most journalists can write words, apparently working straight through the night. Now he was engrossed in fending off the cyber attack: monitoring the waves of incoming traffic and identifying and blocking the attackers. The mood was tense until, after a long 30 minutes, he looked up with a little smile and said the attack seemed to be over.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks continued fighting off similar attacks for several days. Despite all the stress, Julian Assange was in a bouyant mood.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working in that crowded room, he was very focused, but also good humoured and thoughtful of others. For someone at the centre of international news attention, and an international man-hunt, he seemed calm and considered, and not to be taking himself too seriously. He is clearly the central force in the organisation, but there were gutsy people working around him as well. Sometimes they sought his decisions on things and other times they bossed him around.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaked cables, dated from 1966 to February 2010, disclosed confidential communications between the State Department in Washington DC and 274 US embassies around the world. 15,652 of the cables were classified "secret", with another 101,748 "confidential" and 133,887 "unclassified". A WikiLeaks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101128231513/http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/">press release</a> said the cables would give people around the world "an unprecedented insight into US Government foreign activities".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cables show the extent of US spying on its allies and the UN; turning a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in "client states"; backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries; lobbying for US corporations; and the measures US diplomats take to advance those who have access to them.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document release reveals the contradictions between the US’s public persona and what it says behind closed doors – and shows that if citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes, they should ask to see what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian&#8217;s first big story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cables-spying-un" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had ordered her staff to spy on top United Nations officials, including the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, and the Permanent Security Council representatives from China, Russia, France and the UK. Washington wanted biometric data including "DNA, fingerprints and iris scans", along with "credit card numbers, email addresses, phone, fax and pager numbers and even frequent-flyer account numbers". This was a clear breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention, which covers the UN. Another cable revealed that this spying was done at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/wikileaks-cables-cia-united-nations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behest</a> of the CIA. In an interview with Time magazine, Julian Assange called for Hillary Clinton to resign:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"She should resign, if it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering US diplomatic figures to engage in espionage in the United Nations, in violation of the international covenants to which the US has signed up. Yes, she should resign over that."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101210082836/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5igLhpFXyv-VRG5thAgiJk0OORBNw?docId=CNG.7936abe2aac85ef50ca11a2d6b6c031b.dc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that President Obama should also resign, if he had approved the spying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210518041802/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29spy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that US and British diplomats also spied on UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in the weeks before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Annan declared "illegal". State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley blithely dismissed public shock at these revelations.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"This is what diplomats, from our country and other countries, have done for hundreds of years.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>US officials claimed that most of the cables only revealed diplomats hard at work, often doing good things like putting pressure on the Saudi government to let women drive cars. As usual, the latest WikiLeaks release was simultanously "recklessly dangerous" and "putting lives at risk" but also "nothing to see here".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Citizens around the world, however, were shocked by what they discovered. For example: the USA had <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/11/09BERLIN1433.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear weapons</a> in Denmark; European allies were ready to quit the war in Afghanistan; the USA had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-us-manipulated-climate-accord" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliberately undermined</a> the UN&#8217;s 2009 global climate summit in Copenhagen; the USA sought to derail delivery of subsidised Venezuelan petroleum in order to protect the business interests of US oil companies; US companies pressured the government to block an increase in Haiti&#8217;s minimum wage. In Mexico, the US ambassador <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/20/us-ambassador-mexico-resigns-wikileaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned</a> after a leaked cable revealed his complaints about government handling of the war on drug cartels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Tunisia, a cable from the US Ambassador <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-tunisia-first-lady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that President Ben Ali and his regime had "lost touch with the Tunisian people" and were "relying on the police" to cling to power.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Corruption in the inner circle is growing. Even average Tunisians are now keenly aware of it, and the chorus of complaints is rising. Tunisians intensely dislike, even hate, first lady Leila Trabelsi and her family. In private, regime opponents mock her; even those close to the government express dismay at her reported behaviour. Meanwhile, anger is growing at Tunisia&#8217;s high unemployment and regional inequities. As a consequence, the risks to the regime&#8217;s long-term stability are increasing.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten days after this news was reported, a Tunisian market stall holder named Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, sparking local riots that spread and eventually triggered "Arab Spring" revolutions across the Middle East. Many of the protestors cited WikiLeaks revelations as conclusive evidence of long-suspected corruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A blogger at <a href="http://www.arabist.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Arabist</a> suggested that the Cablegate leaks had particular impact in the Arab world, where media criticism of the US government was seldom tolerated despite wisespread public cynicism. Pakistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations were especially impacted by the cables, with neighbouring Iraq and Afghanista among the most discussed topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaked cables lead to hundreds of stories around the world (well beyond the scope of this book) and an avalance of diplomatic fallout which continued for many years. Even a decade later, old US cables were still being produced as evidence whenever cited events, facts and public figures became newsworthy.  The cables were eventually merged into WikiLeaks' searchable "Plus D" <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/plusd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Library of US Diplomacy</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite writing to Europol, Interpol, and British authorities, none of the "various arrest warrants" were provided to them. Assange&#8217;s lawyers said they were not provided with any evidence from Sweden or even an allegation in English.</p>

<p>The letter, which was released to the press, begins: "Dear Ms Robinson and Mr Assange. I am writing in response to your 26 November 2010 letter to US Ambassador Louis B Susman regarding your intention to again publish on your WikiLeaks site what you claim to be classified US government documents." Robinson said: "By eliding client and lawyer, that was a very inappropriate attempt to implicate me. That is really inappropriate to come from the State Department of all places; they understand very well the rules on attorney-client protocol."</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s lawyers were negotiating a date for him to appear before a court and negotiate bail. Publicly, they refused to even confirm that the WikiLeaks founder was still in Britain. But after media reported that he was "in hiding", Kristinn Hrafnsson explained: “he is not in hiding, the authorities here, the police know where he is." The Guardian reported that Assange was "seeking supporters to put up surety" and "expected to have to post bail of between £100,000 and £200,000".</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am an Australian citizen and I miss my country a great deal. However, during the last weeks the Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, and the attorney general, Robert McClelland, have made it clear that not only is my return is impossible but that they are actively working to assist the United States government in its attacks on myself and our people. This brings into question what does it mean to be an Australian citizen - does that mean anything at all? Or are we all to be treated like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Hicks</a> at the first possible opportunity merely so that Australian politicians and diplomats can be invited to the best US embassy cocktail parties.</p>

<p>On the same day that Julian Assange was jailed, 7 December 2010, US officials <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/are-assanges-fears-justified-20120622-20u6i.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to the Australian embassy in Washington that the Justice Department was conducting an "active and vigorous inquiry into  whether Julian Assange can be charged under US law, most likely the 1917 Espionage Act". They said: "the WikiLeaks case is unprecedented both in its scale and nature". Two weeks later the embassy advised Canberra that media reports of a secret WikiLeaks grand jury were "likely true". In spite of this, Australian government officials publicly pretended for over eight years that Assange&#8217;s extradition case was just about the Swedish sex allegations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the two prosecutors attached to the WikiLeaks Grand Jury was US attorney Neil McBride, who was forced to <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/08/23/us-attorney-neil-mcbride-to-step-down-amid-probes-into-mcdonnell-and-wikileaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resign</a> from his "dream job" just three years later. MacBride was nominated by President Obama to run the Eastern District jurisdiction, which is home to both the Pentagon and the CIA and handles most US "national security" cases. In addition to WikiLeak, MacBride was involved in prosecuting National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Megaupload file-sharing site&#8217;s German founder Kim Dotcom. In the wake of the 2001 terror attacks, McBride made a name for himself by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-vas-eastern-district-us-attorneys-reach-transcends-geographic-bounds/2012/12/15/a3f8f992-4625-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanding</a> extraterritorial applications of US criminal law.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach aligned neatly with the dominant US Neoconservative view that, with the end of the Cold War, the USA was now the sole superpower and thus "<a href="https://www.antiwar.com/orig/lind1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the American Century</a>" was just beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Senator Joe Lieberman was also keen to adjust existing laws. On 2 December 2010, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101206214522/http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/news-events/news/2010/12/bipartisan-legislation-goes-after-wikileaks-by-amending-espionage-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a bipartisan plan to amend the 1917 Espionage Act in order “to go after Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange.” John Ensign was one of two Republican Senators who co-signed the plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Julian Assange and his cronies, in their effort to hinder our war efforts, are creating a hit list for our enemies by publishing the names of our human intelligence sources,” said Ensign. “Our sources are bravely risking their lives when they stand up against the tyranny of al-Qaeda, the Taliban and murderous regimes, and I simply will not stand idly by as they become death targets because of Julian Assange. Let me be very clear, WikiLeaks is not a whistleblower website and Assange is not a journalist.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The argument that Assange was not a journalist was widely repeated in the media, implicitly suggesting that the Australian would not receive US First Amendment protections if he was charged under US law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CIA meanwhile <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122104599.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2010122105304n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up</a> a new "WikiLeaks Task Force", whose official acronym W.T.F. was met with much mirth by WikiLeaks supporters. And the Daily Beast reported that the Obama administration was planning "a major reshuffling of diplomats, military officers, and intelligence operatives at US embassies around the world out of concern that WikiLeaks has made it impossible — if not dangerous — for many of the Americans to remain in their current posts”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Journalists who worked with WikiLeaks were also under growing pressure as stories continued appearing. The editors of El Pais wrote a strong <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2010/12/23/inenglish/1293085243_850210.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial</a> defending their decision to publish the cables:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The publication of the diplomatic cables has stirred international opinion and surprised some governments, who often adduce false arguments to downplay or discredit this news bomb. The security of individual sources has been assured by eliminating names and data that might endanger them, as the reader will have noticed. The media that have published the revelations have acted within the limits sketched out by the US Supreme Court in the Pentagon Papers case, opting for freedom of information and the citizen’s right to know. As for the relevance of the information, the pages of this newspaper speak for themselves.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no historical precedent for this in term of scope, as it affects so many conflicts throughout the world. The revelations show a seamy side of the political world, about which we all had well-grounded suspicions, but no clear certainty. We are, in a sense, freer now than we were before, which is as much as journalism can hope to achieve.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, US Air Force staff and other US government employees were blocked from accessing the news websites of El Pais, the Guardian, the New York Times or other news organisations reporting on the WikiLeaks cables. The Wall Street Journal reported on 15 December 2010 that at least 25 sites were barred. Staff who attempted to access them received an on-screen message: "Access denied. Internet usage is logged and monitored."</p>

<p>Despite all these attacks, TIME magazine argued that WikiLeaks was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101210080915/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2035817,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning</a> the "asymmetric info war" and Assange&#8217;s arrest was "a win, not a loss, for his organization". The more brutally the US government cracked down on WikiLeaks, the more public support the organisation achieved.</p>

<p>On 14 December 2010 Julian Assange&#8217;s mother Christine gave Australian media a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101215183913/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/12/20101214123820381879.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written statement</a> from her son after visiting him in jail:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julian Assange was released from jail two days later after supporters posted a massive £200,000 bail. He addressed a huge gathering of supporters and flashbulb-popping journalists outside London&#8217;s Royal Courts of Justice.</p>

There are much bigger concerns about being extradited to the United States&#8230;&#8203; I hope to continue my work and continue protesting my innocence in this matter.”</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange <a href="https://archive.is/cKqo4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> his conditions in jail as “solitary confinement in the bottom of a Victorian prison.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite granting bail, the UK High Court ruled that Assange would have to wear an electronic ankle tag, abide by a curfew and meet daily with the police. His passport was not returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In granting bail [the judge] stipulated that two of Mr. Assange’s closest WikiLeaks associates, Joseph Farrell and Sarah Harrison, were required to add financial guarantees to those from the prominent people who had vouched for Mr. Assange.</p>

<p>The WikiLeaks founder was effectively placed under house arrest at a 10-bedroom Norfolk mansion named Ellingham Hall, which was owned by Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club for journalists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The supposedly left-wing Guardian newspaper had a noticably <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/14/julian-assange-bail-vaughan-smith" target="_blank" rel="noopener">odd take</a> on these court proceedings. Luke Harding and Sam Jones claimed that "it was the maverick British establishment that rode to the rescue of Julian Assange, offering to whisk him from dull confinement in Wandsworth jail to a large and comfy manor house".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For once, Assange was not the star at the afternoon bail hearing at Westminster magistrates' court&#8230;&#8203; Instead the hero was Vaughan Smith, a former army officer, journalist adventurer and rightwing libertarian.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They said Assange could look forward to "pheasant dinners, port and brisk walks around the estate" but "according to friends, Assange shows little interest in food, and is invariably late for meals."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, Vaughan Smith told the court Assange was "a very honourable person, hugely clever, self-deprecatory and warm. Not the kind of things you read about."</p>

<div class="title">Julian Assange at Ellingham Hall, 17 December 2010</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking to journalists outside Ellingham Hall the next day, Assange said the threat of onwards extradition to the United States "seems to be increasingly serious and increasingly likely."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unbeknownst to Assange, two new prongs of attack were already underway. Firstly the US government was demanding the private Twitter account details of WikiLeaks insiders. And the Bank of America, which was rumoured to be the target of WikiLeaks' next big release, had contracted private security companies to go after the whistle-blowing site.</p>

<p>A day later, on 18 December 2010, US vice-president Joe Biden was asked about Assange on NBC&#8217;s Meet the Press.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asked if he saw Assange as closer to a hi-tech terrorist than the whistleblower who released the Pentagon papers in the 1970s, which disclosed the lie on which US involvement in Vietnam was based, Biden replied: "I would argue it is closer to being a hi-tech terrorist than the Pentagon papers".</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the previous day, Biden had said "I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any substantive damage" from the WikiLeaks publications. Now he walked that back:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"He&#8217;s made it more difficult for us to conduct our business with our allies and our friends. For example, in my meetings – you know I meet with most of these world leaders – there is a desire now to meet with me alone, rather than have staff in the room. It makes things more cumbersome – so it has done damage."</p>

<pre>Is WikiLeaks really the greatest threat that we face?
Or is it the response we are seeing in defence of the state?
A response that is building and seeks
To turn back the clock on freedom of speech
And fundamental rights earned over a century.
This should ring alarm bells for all who know their history...
History books will be written about events this month:
The story they will tell is up to us.</pre>
