<h2 id="_chapter_thirteen_early_2012">Chapter Thirteen: Early 2012</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In January 2012, Rolling Stone magazine published a lengthy and revealing <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/julian-assange-the-rolling-stone-interview-234403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Julian Assange. Author Michael Hastings - whose book about the Afghan War, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operators-Terrifying-Inside-Americas-Afghanistan/dp/0399159886/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325863637&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Operators</a>, lead to the resignation of "rock star" US General Stanley McChrystal - spent three days with Assange at Ellingham Hall. He compared the 40-year-old WikiLeaks founder to an "embattled rebel commander" whose protracted legal battles had left him "isolated, broke and vulnerable".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange recently spoke to someone he calls a Western “intelligence source,” and he asked the official about his fate. Will he ever be a free man again, allowed to return to his native Australia, to come and go as he pleases?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“He told me I was fucked,” Assange says.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange explained how WikiLeaks had come to focus on Western states:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially we thought that our greatest role would be in China and some former Soviet states and in Africa. We did have early successes in Africa. I lived in Kenya in 2007, and we were able to source a document that exposed billions of dollars of corruption by the former president Daniel arap Moi and his cronies. The evidence ended up swinging the vote by 10 percent and changing the Kenyan election. But Moi’s corruption didn’t exist in Kenya alone. The money looted from Kenya was deposited into London banks, properties and businesses, into New York properties. There is no large-scale corruption in the developing world without Western corruption. That was an important lesson to me.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important lesson was that, very quickly, we started receiving information from what we presumed to be disaffected U.S. government employees about the actions of the U.S. military. The United States has historically been a relatively open society. But within the United States, there is a shadow state, and that is the U.S. military, which, as of September, held 4.3 million security clearances. That is equal to the population of New Zealand. That is a closed, totalitarian society that gathers and stores more information than any other society in the world.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Hastings suggested that Assange was waging "a lifelong campaign against authority", he took exception.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legitimate authority is important. All human systems require authority, but authority must be granted as a result of the informed consent of the governed. Presently, the consent, if there is any, is not informed, and therefore it’s not legitimate. To communicate knowledge, we must protect people’s privacy – and so I have been, for 20 years, developing systems and policy and ideals to protect people’s rights to communicate privately without government interference, without government surveillance. The right to communicate without government surveillance is important, because surveillance is another form of censorship. When people are frightened that what they are saying may be overheard by a power that has the ability to lock people up, then they adjust what they’re saying. They start to self-censor.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also rebuked the suggestion that he had "a massive ego".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t think I have a massive ego. I just am firm at saying no. No, we will not destroy everything we’ve already published. No, we will continue to publish what we have promised to publish. No, we will not stop dealing with U.S. military leaks. For some people, that comes across as a big ego, when it’s just sticking to your ideals.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said his confrontation with the Western national-security state – "it’s not quite right to call it the U.S. national-security state, because it’s a transnational phenomenon" – had brought out the best and worst in people.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In November, I told our people, perhaps to their surprise, that what we were doing was more significant than the life of any one of us. To that degree, the battles that we’ve had, the severity of the battles that we’ve had, is not something I have found to be difficult to deal with. Their severity is a reflection of the quality and importance of our work. That said, the betrayals are hard to take&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said that many people who had "an involvement to some extent in our work" then overstated their contribution "to gain authority". Then, when WikiLeaks was not able or willing to continue the relationship, "they feel rejected".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What they lose through the lack of an ongoing relationship seems to be so incredibly valuable to them, so their desire to keep it, or their feeling of loss when they are not able to preserve the interaction, is so extreme that it drives them to do things you would not normally expect people to do.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said his children had received death threats and numerous stalkers had turned up at the front door of his rural retreat - "three hours out of London by fast train, plus another 40 minutes in a car through country roads, and then through a long private driveway into the country house" - including many "women who thought they were my fiancee" and a certain Captain Morgan, who sold his ship and came to help "the only organization on Earth worth working for."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I always thought that A-level celebrities and their complaints about the difficulties of being a celebrity were rather self-indulgent. I’ve subsequently changed my opinion. Brad Pitt doesn’t have a superpower at his back. He just has some crazed fans and paparazzi. But now, having had all three, I must say, I’m not terribly impressed with the experience.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said he had received a list of US government priorities "from an intelligence source" on the same day the Swedish sex allegations against him appeared. It said the US would find mounting a legal case against him very difficult, so therefore "I should be very cautious about extralegal means" such as "the planting of drugs, child pornography or being otherwise embroiled in disgraceful conduct". He said he didn’t take the "politicized sex scandal" very seriously at first because "I thought that it would disappear immediately".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We hired someone in the U.K. to cope with the volume of media inquiries. He accepted at a very substantially reduced rate because we’re activists, a cause célèbre. His largest clients were Virgin and Sony. After one week, it was clear that it was either us or them. His board, according to him, insisted that we be dropped, so we were. There have been about a dozen similar instances of pressure being applied to companies who we’ve been working with. When people say, “Why didn’t Julian do this, why didn’t Julian do that, why didn’t WikiLeaks do this,” in many cases we have actually tried. It’s not so easy when you’re fighting a superpower.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said he was now "completely bankrupt" as a result of the Swedish extradition case, which he had so far had to finance himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t think that is right. Actually, I think the organization should pay for it. It is unquestionable that the case has been politicized as a result of my role in the organization.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said he wanted to go back to doing his work and traveling the world but had no idea whether WikiLeaks would even survive:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This week, I think we’ll make it. We’ll see what happens next week.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s many supporters around the world were doing what they could to help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Australian Senator Scott Ludlam sent an email to Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bild detailing <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prejudicial public statements</a> made by Swedish officials and requesting their retraction "or at the very least cessation". Ludlam then accompanied WikiLeaks spokesman Jacob Applebaum back to Australia, where they both addressed a <a href="https://vimeo.com/efaoz/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packed house</a> at Melbourn&#8217;s Trades Hall. The "War On The Internet" panel included Julian Assange&#8217;s old friend Suellette Dreyfus and Crikey journalist Bernard Keane, plus a pre-recorded video message from Assange.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ludlam later <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/01/24/greens-mp-fears-phone-was-hacked-in-wikileaks-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complained</a> that his iPhone appeared to have been hacked by government officials, perhaps trying to obtain information on Appelbaum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With help from supporters, Julian&#8217;s mother Christine Assange - who also suffered years of bizarre problems with her phone, Internet and email - set up a <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> and posted a <a href="https://jaraparilla.blogspot.com/2012/01/australia-day-call-to-action-from.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list</a> of imaginative protest actions for Australia Day January 26.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Senator Ludlam and Christine Assange appeared together weeks later at another panel in Sydney, "Don&#8217;t Shoot the Messenger", chaired by popular TV news host Mary Kostakidis. They then continued to a Brisbane forum "The War on Wikileaks" in March.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the USA, meanwhile, WikiLeaks’ lawyer Jennifer Robinson was attending a film on slavery at the Sundance Film Festival when she happened to bump into US Attorney General Eric Holder. She asked him about his intention to prosecute Julian Assange.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“How do you think history will reflect upon your treatment of WikiLeaks and Assange?”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Holder&#8217;s casual demeanour immediately changed when he realised Robinson was Assange&#8217;s lawyer.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“The release of confidential information is a very serious matter, and we have to draw the line somewhere,” he said.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3 id="_uk_supreme_court_appeal">UK Supreme Court Appeal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 2 February 2012 Julian Assange’s final appeal against extradition to Sweden was heard at the UK Supreme Court in London. A huge crowd of protestors, police and media observers gathered outside the court for the two day hearing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s lawyers <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that the European Arrest Warrant system should be consistent across all countries involved, but in fact there were widely varying and inconsistent applications of law across the continent, and Sweden&#8217;s use of the system was especially questionable. In particular, Assange&#8217;s lawyers claimed that Swedish public prosecutor Marrianne Ny did not qualify as a legitimate "judicial authority" who could personally issue a European Arreest Warrant without any Swedish judicial or court involvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Former Assange counsel Geoffrey Robertson QC wrote an <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/31/geoffrey-robertson-assange-s-appeal-rests-on-judicial-authority.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> supporting this argument:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The notion that a prosecutor is a ‘judicial authority’ is a contradiction in terms. &#8230;&#8203; Judges must, as their defining quality, be independent of government. Police and prosecutors employed and promoted by the state obviously cannot be perceived as impartial if they are permitted to decide issues on the liberty of individuals. They are expected to be zealous in working up evidence against a suspect, so they are the last people who can be trusted to weigh up impartially the evidence they themselves have drummed up. That is a matter for a court."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another key issue for the judges to consider was Britain&#8217;s 2003 Extradition Act, which was introduced as part of the "war on terror" to facilitate the process of extraditing "persons of interest." Would Julian Assange be treated the same as a terrorist?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the final week of February 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing more than five million emails from the Texas-headquartered "global intelligence" company Stratfor. As previously mentioned in <a href="ch9.html">Chapter Nine</a>, the most shocking revelation was an email from Fred Burton, Stratfor&#8217;s Vice-President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security, who claimed that the US Grand Jury had prepared a sealed indictment for Assange at least a year earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<p>A WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Stratfor-Emails-US-Has-Issued.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> showed how comments from the ex-CIA staff at Stratfor were closely aligned with US government tactics, and how Burton boasted of his ability to get hold of confidential US government information:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Emails from Fred Burton reveal that the US Government employs the same counterterrorism strategy against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as against Al Qaeda: "Take down the money. Go after his infrastructure. The tools we are using to nail and de-construct Wiki are the same tools used to dismantle and track aQ [Al Qaeda]. Thank Cheney &amp; 43 [former US President George W. Bush]. Big Brother owns his liberal terrorist arse."</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten days after the CIA reportedly assassinated Osama bin Laden, Burton writes in an email sent to Stratfor&#8217;s "Secure" mailing list that he "can get access to the materials seized from the OBL [Osama bin Laden] safe house."</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Burton states: "Ferreting out Julian Assange&#8217;s confederates is also key. Find out what other disgruntled rogues inside the tent or outside [sic]. Pile on.

<p>Burton, a former US State Department counterterrorism expert, suggested the US government would pursue "conspiracy and political terrorism charges" and then "declassify the death of a source" and blame it on WikiLeaks. His preferred strategy was to "bankrupt the arsehole first&#8230;&#8203; ruin his life. Give him 7-12 yrs for conspiracy."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were over 4,000 Stratfor emails that mentioned WikiLeaks or Assange, including multiple mentions of a sealed indictment going back to as early as June 2010, after the release of the Collateral Murder video but prior to the Afghan War Diaries release. The emails also showed how Stratfor monitored and analysed the online activities of Bhopal activists for the US chemical giant Dow Chemical. They also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/27/wikileaks-stratfor-emails-anonymous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed</a> the revolving door of staff moving between US private intelligence companies and the United States government.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Emails between the founder and Karl Rove, a senior advisor to George Bush, are among those released to date.

His first guest was Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon&#8217;s Shia militant group Hezbollah, who had not spoken to the media for six years and had not done an English-language interview for over a decade. Even the Guardian&#8217;s Luke Harding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/17/world-tomorrow-julian-assange-wikileaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceded</a> that Assange had "scored a genuine coup".</p>

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The show was produced by Quick Roll Productions, a company established by Julian Assange with the help of Dartmouth Films, who also released films from John Pilger. British company <a href="https://journeyman.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journeyman Pictures</a> handled the distribution while British-Tamil rap star <a href="http://www.miauk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M.I.A.</a> composed the theme song. Italian newspaper L&#8217;Espresso made the program available online in Italian. But Russia Today (RT) provided the bulk of the funding by purchasing the international broadcast rights in English, Arabic, Russian and Spanish. This of course lead to predictable criticism from Assange haters like Luke Harding:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mystery is why Assange should agree to become a pawn in the Kremlin&#8217;s global information war. Perhaps he needs the money. Assange&#8217;s anti-American agenda, of course, fits neatly with the Kremlin&#8217;s own.</p>

<p>Assange also did a 20 minute <a href="https://youtu.be/v5nHrCMExaQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Russia Today, making it clear that he had full editorial control of his program.

<p>He also explained what motivated him to create the show:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As someone who has given a lot of interviews before, and been on the receiving end of very aggressive interview styles, I found that I wasn&#8217;t giving much away in interviews at all.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The World Tomorrow" gave globally important figures an opportunity to speak on their own terms but Assange was far from a pushover as a host. Reviewing the first episode, Glenn Greewald <a href="https://www.salon.com/2012/04/18/attacks_on_rt_and_assange_reveal_much_about_the_critics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Assange had conducted an "aggressive, adversarial interview&#8230;&#8203; something most American TV personalities would be loathe to do".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But not only that, Assange&#8217;s questions were grounded in support for the Syrian opposition forces and were hostile to the Assad government: exactly the reverse of the Russian government&#8217;s position, which has maintained steadfast support for Assad.</p>

<p>The second episode of the show put “intellectual superstar” Slavoj Žižek up against "unrepentant Zionist" David Horowitz, a hardline US conservative.

<p>Interviewee Imran Khan, who went on to become Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2018, said people like him "would never have had a chance of coming into power" before WikiLeaks cables exposed "two faced politicians".

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange also interviewed the new Tunisian President, Moncef Marzouki, who had been jailed by former dictator Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali and spent years living in exile. Episode four included jailed Arab Spring activists Nabeel Rajab from Bahrain and Alaa Abd El-Fattah from Egypt; both men would spend many more months in prison as the political gains of the Arab Spring were wound back.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But given what was about to happen to Assange, his most important guest must have been Rafael Correa, the President of Ecuador. Episode six went to air on 22 May, just weeks before Assange sought political asylum in Ecuador&#8217;s London embassy. They discussed how Correa had <a href="https://youtu.be/0n5bvuakWAU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stared down</a> a violent 2010 coup attempt and how his attempts to limit corrupt media propaganda were being mis-characterized in the West as attacks on press freedom. Assange described how he had naively attended a Latin American media alliance - Sociedad Interamericana de Prensa (SIP) or Inter American Press Association (IAPA) - and was "horrified" by the blatant levels of <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Governments+fight+media+concentration-a0240864415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corruption</a>. Correa noted how corrupt media in Latin America had frequently misreported the US State Department cables from WikiLeaks, and said he was trying to promote free public media as a way to balance corrupt corporate journalism. He argued that in Latin America today "media power was and is probably much greater than political power" because those who controlled the media also controlled politicians and judges:</p>

Governments who are trying to do something for the great majority of people, we are persecuted by journalists who believe that [they can] just insult people and engage in calumny. Please, the whole world should understand what is going on in Latin America. When I got to the government, there were seven national television channels, there was no public service television - all of them private. Five of them belonged to bankers.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange noted that WikiLeaks had experienced similar problems with media partners trying to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/19/wikileaks-cables-ecuador-julian-assange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misrepresent</a> the cables, even in defiance of legal agreements.

<p>Correa said WikiLeaks had actually strengthened his government. In the wake of the Cablegate publications, he expelled the US Ambassador, saying her arrogance was an insult to his nation.

<p>Correa also joked about Ecuador shutting down the US military base in Manta, saying it would not have been a problem if US officials had just let Ecuador build a military base in the United States.

<p>So when Bob Carr says "consular support," what he means is the Foreign Minister&#8217;s office coming to court and observing what&#8217;s going on so that he can write a brief to the minister in order to best prepare the minister&#8217;s press lines. None of that information comes back to us. And when we&#8217;ve tried to get hold of it, for example through the Freedom of Information Act or when the Sydney Morning Herald has tried to get hold of it, 95% of it is entirely blacked out, with FOIs being withheld in some cases for 18 months. Even though legally they should only be held for 40 days&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Look, I don&#8217;t even have the rights of the defendant, because I haven&#8217;t been charged. I don&#8217;t have a right to see any evidence against me, see the detailed allegations against me, to counter these matters in a legal way, because I am not even a defendant. We have a basic notion in Australia that you are free to go about your life as an adult until the Government charges you with an offence. And then you must have your day in court, and it&#8217;s the Government&#8217;s responsibility to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that you have done something wrong. But until at least being charged, let alone convicted, you are free to go about your life as a free citizen. For the last 540 days, I have been detained without charge.</p>

<h3 id="_uk_supreme_court_gets_it_wrong">UK Supreme Court Gets It Wrong</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 30 May 2012 Britain&#8217;s Supreme Court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/30/julian-assange-challenge-extradition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> by five to two that Julian Assange&#8217;s extradition appeal had failed. To avoid leaks, lawyers were not shown the judgments until 8.30 that morning. This was odd; draft judgments are normally circulated to counsel up to a week before delivery so that they can point out any minor errors such as mis-spelled names or incorrect dates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange was not present in the Westminster courtroom (there was no legal requirement for him to be there) - his solicitor, Gareth Peirce, explained that he was stuck in traffic. A scene from the video documentary <a href="https://youtu.be/obhDnc1tl7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RISK</a> shows him in a car with Sarah Harrison, on the phone to others, asking what was happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What was happening was quite unusual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lord Phillips explained that his fellow judges believed Swedish prosecutor Marrianne Ny qualified as a "judicial authority" and therefore her European Arrest Warrant was valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But then Assange&#8217;s representative, Dinah Rose QC, addressed the court. She said nobody had even asked her about the key issue on which three of the five ruling judges claimed to have based their decision. This was all about Article 31.3 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that treaties can be interpreted bearing in mind the "subsequent practice" of their application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One judge said this opportunity to "interpret" the meaning of European law was a "determinative" point. Another said he based his conclusion "principally" on this point. A third said it was "ultimately critical". And yet this critical point had not even been discussed in court.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Joshua Rozenberg <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/30/assange-extradition-halted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>, this was "very embarrassing for the Supreme Court":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The judges gave Rose two weeks to make written submissions on this point. "If she decides to do so", they said later, they would "then decide whether to re-open the appeal and accept further submissions (either verbally through a further hearing, or on paper) on the matter."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, the judges may decide that they were entitled to take the Vienna convention into account. In that event, they would presumably confirm the decision they delivered today. But given two weeks to prepare her case, Rose could well come up with other arguments. In the meantime, Assange can stay in the UK.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was the first time the UK Supreme Court had been forced to re-open a case since the 1998 Pinochet extradition drama, in which prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC was also involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As John Pilger observed:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"This case moves in mysterious ways and we are about to move into another mysterious stage of this whole unnecessary process."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, things were even more mysterious than Assange&#8217;s legal team knew. In 2021 Stefania Maurizi provided <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/in-edicola/articoli/2021/01/06/will-assange-be-able-to-appeal-to-the-european-court-of-human-rights-to-fight-his-extradition-to-the-us/6056754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proof</a> that Swedish and UK authorities had been secretly plotting ways to extradite Julian Assange after the "expected" Supreme Court ruling and before he could file an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The FOIA document reveals that on the 8th of December 2011, the Swedish member of Eurojust – the European Union’s agency for criminal justice cooperation – contacted his British counterpart expressing optimism that the British Supreme Court in London would deliver a verdict in Sweden’s favor. “It is my experience in similar situations from Eurojust it is important with a pick as close to the decision as possible to avoid conflicts with an expected appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. After the 10 days time frame there is no longer a possibility to have coercive measures against Mr A”.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, according to what the then Swedish member of Eurojust wrote in his emails to the British member, Sweden aimed to extradite Julian Assange before he could appeal to the European Court for protective measures.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In normal circumstances, if the Supreme Court had not stuffed things up, Assange would have had only 14 days to surrended to UK authorities. Instead his lawyers filed a new 18-page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120704084429/http://www.slideshare.net/swedenversusassange/120612-appellants-application-to-re-open-judgment-12612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submission</a> nearly two weeks later, on 12 June 2012. The application included a request for the Supreme Court to correct their false statement that Assange "stands charged" in Sweden.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"It is notable that, following the hearing, the Court on three occasions wrote to the parties seeking further written submissions on points which the Court was considering including in its judgment, but which had not been argued before it, including elements of the Parliamentary process, and the applicability of Pupino. The applicability and effect of Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT was not raised even at that stage. It is of particular note that the issues upon which the parties were afforded the opportunity to make subsequent written submissions were ultimately determined against the Respondent. The Respondent thus was afforded an opportunity to make submissions upon new issues which were adverse to the Respondent’s interest. By contrast, the Appellant was afforded no opportunity to make submissions upon the single issue, arising post-hearing, that was to be decided adversely to him, and determinatively so.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/12/julian-assange-appeal-extradition-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> noted that if the UK Supreme Court upheld their ruling, Assange could still take his case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), "further delaying the extradition process for many months".</p>

<p>But by now Assange had totally lost faith in UK authorities. Weeks later he <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/2012-06-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Australia&#8217;s ABC News:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"They tried to cancel the 14 days that I had here to apply to appeal the matter at the European Court of Human Rights".</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took the Supreme Court only two days to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120704084429/https://justice4assange.com/Supreme-Court-Appeal,65.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn down</a> Assange&#8217;s last minute appeal. The Australian&#8217;s final appeal to British justice had failed. Assange supporters claimed that British justice had, in fact, failed. The award-winning journalist, editor and publisher had only fourteen days to surrended to UK authorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At 11 pm that night, UK government security contractors <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/213390916336091137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrived</a> at Assange&#8217;s residence demanding to fit a new tagging device on his ankle, claiming the battery signal was low.

<p>On 4 June 2012 Julian Assange vented his frustration in an Australia radio <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For over 540 days, I&#8217;ve had an electronic manacle around my leg, being under house arrest, being forced to be in this country because of one reason: the Swedish Government will not come to this country and interview me. They will not interview me on the phone. It is perfectly within their legal entitlements – there are standing treaties to do this, called the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — and it is done, in other cases in Sweden. So the case has not progressed because I am suspicious of what is happening in Sweden and the Swedes will not provide us sure answers. The obvious thing to do — the Swedish Government was criticized in the high court — is simply to pick up the telephone and call me. Or if they want to do it in person, to meet me. Or if they want to do it on Swedish soil it can be at the Embassy. Or they can use standard treaty techniques like the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. It makes you wonder what the hell is going on? And is this how a government operates, is operating, in good faith?</p>

<p>On 17 June 2012 WikiLeaks Central posted a <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of a new book, "A Brief History of Swedish Sex":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Structured as a timeline, the volume vividly illustrates how a political coup by a group of radical feminists at the highest levels of government caused the free-love era of "Swedish sin" to give way to a wave of anti-sex and anti-male hysteria that vilified heterosexual sex and villainized men. It was into this morass that WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange waded when he had consensual sexual relations with Anna Ardin and Sofia Wilén&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and then became the target of a Sweden-initiated international manhunt.</p>

<p>On 19 June Christine Assange <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a long list of tweets about the extradition process:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Australian PM Julia Gillard and Opposition leader Tony Abbot backed new Extradition Act Amendments making it easier for U.S.A to extradite Aussies. The Greens fought it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the FIRST TIME Aussies can be now be extradited for minor offences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protection of "political" motives has been weakened. If the charge is "terrorism" then "political" cannot apply to prevent extradition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.S.A. recently expanded its definition of "terrorist" to include peaceful protesters - "Low level terrorism".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the new NDAA legislation, the U.S became a police state - citizens and foreigners can be arrested without warrant and indefinite detention applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1971 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it legal to publish classified documents. Obama is now trying to label media who do so as terrorists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications to the act included changing "protection from death penalty" to "likelihood the death penalty would be carried out".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that the U.S.A is in the top 5 countries for killing its own citizens, and the only Western country in that top 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even Minor Offences under the new Extradition Amendments are punished with up to 12 months imprisonment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK/US Bilateral Treaty allows the U.S.A to extradite from the UK without any prima facie case (i.e. evidence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Swedish/US Bilateral Treaty gets around safeguards of normal extradition with a fast-track "Temporary Surrender" clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US Grand Jury convenes in secret. There are 4 prosecutors, no defence, and no judge. It can issue indictments for Extradition with no proper legal process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sweden has not refused an Extradition request from the USA for over 20 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2001 Sweden gave two innocent Egyptian refugees to the CIA for rendition to Egypt, where they were tortured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Swedish Justice Minister who signed off on the CIA rendition torture flight was Thomas Bodström.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thomas Bodström is now the business partner of Claes Borgström, the politician/lawyer of the two Swedish women in the Assange case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Australian Greens supported a motion by Senator Scott Ludlam to protect Julian from "Temporary Surrender" to the U.S.A via Sweden. Both Labor and the Coalition opposed it.</p>
