<p>In early August 2011 former WikiLeaks staffer Daniel Domscheit-Berg <a href="https://www-spiegel-de.translate.goog/netzwelt/netzpolitik/streit-mit-assange-ex-sprecher-vernichtete-wikileaks-dateien-a-781458.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted</a> his doomed "OpenLeaks" whistleblower site with a lecture at a summer camp of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), where he challenged members to crack the security of his new platform. Andy Müller-Maguhn - a CCC board member who had spent nearly one year secretly trying to mediate the return of WikiLeaks data "stolen" by Domscheit-Berg and others - was <a href="https://www-spiegel-de.translate.goog/netzwelt/netzpolitik/chaos-computer-club-hacker-distanzieren-sich-von-openleaks-a-780103.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">furious</a> that Domscheit-Berg had "given the impression that OpenLeaks is being tested by our people and thus given a kind of CCC seal of approval".</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We do not allow ourselves to be captured. That was outrageous."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The five-person CCC board then expelled Domscheit-Berg for exploiting the "good reputation of the association" in order to promote a supposedly "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source</a>" project which they said was "non-transparent". They questioned whether "potential whistleblowers who confide in OpenLeaks can and will be protected in the long term".</p>

<p>Days later, Domscheit-Berg - who had only recently <a href="https://www.freitag.de/autoren/steffen-kraft/wir-fordern-kein-vertrauen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeated</a> his <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lie</a> that he "didn&#8217;t take any documents from WikiLeaks" - told <a href="https://www-spiegel-de.translate.goog/netzwelt/netzpolitik/streit-mit-assange-ex-sprecher-vernichtete-wikileaks-dateien-a-781458.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Der Spiegel</a> that he had "destroyed more than 3,500 unpublished files". He said he had "shredded the files in the last few days to ensure that the sources are not endangered" because he believed Julian Assange could not guarantee safe handling of the material.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks responded with two statements on WikiLeaks Central in less than twenty minutes. The first <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2170" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement by Julian Assange</a> was carefully worded to provide WikiLeaks sources with information but also avoid legal problems. It outlined multiple historic concerns about Daniel Domscheit-Berg, including his wife&#8217;s high-profile contact with German government officials and a rumour that "the girlfriend of a Berlin-based Israeli intelligence officer" had attended their wedding. Assange said he had "received a warning from a current Western intelligence officer that DDB has been in contact with the FBI, on more than one occasion, and that the information from this contact was 'helpful'." Assange had also "received intelligence from current Western intelligence officer, that Anke Domscheit Berg, personally, came into contact with the CIA" although he had no proof that either Daniel or Anke Domscheit-Berg were "complicit" in such contacts.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks does not record or retain source identifying information, however the claimed destruction of documents entrusted to WikiLeaks between January 2010 and August 2010 demands the revelation of inside information so sources can make their own risk assessments&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>DDB secretly, and in clear violation of WikiLeaks internal security directives, recorded internal WikiLeaks encrypted "chat" conversations. He initially publicly denied having done so, but attempted to place many of these recordings into his ghostwritten book, most of which were rejected by his publishers' lawyers as violations of german privacy law. Others he secretly conveyed to hostile media, such as Wired magazine, which had been involved in the arrest and persecution of US intelligence analyst Bradley Manning.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After DDB&#8217;s suspension in August 2010, he managed, through guile, to convince a German WikiLeaks system administrator, who was an old associate of DDB&#8217;s, to obtain the keys and data for a large quantity of then pending WikiLeaks whistleblower disclosures.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2171" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second statement</a> further claimed that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had also taken "internal communications and over 3000 unpublished, private whistleblower communications to WikiLeaks" along with the "secure online submissions system, funds and internal documentation".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mr. Domscheit-Berg has repeatedly attempted to blackmail WikiLeaks by threatening to make available, to forces that oppose WikiLeaks, these private communications and to which Mr. Domscheit-Berg is not a party. He has stated he will commit this action, should WikiLeaks move to charge him with sabotage or theft. Mr. Domscheit-Berg has refused to return the various materials he has stolen, saying he needs them, solely, to carry out this threat. Mr. Domscheit-Berg has already, secretly, and with malicious intent, disclosed portions of the private communications content to other parties, to the harm of WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks noted that their sources "have in some cases risked their lives or freedom" attempting to convey leaked information but "WikiLeaks does not collect or retain source identifying information, so fortunately, source identities for this material are not significantly at risk".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to provide an environment which would encourage Mr. Domscheit-Berg to return what he has stolen and not to use it for malicious purposes, we have made no further statements until today. This diplomatic silence has been difficult for us, and, is perhaps a warning lesson about secret diplomacy. While we have been silent in order to maximize the chances of regaining the material that was entrusted to us, Mr. Domscheit-Berg has issued dozens of legally harmful falsehoods&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Sadly it was already too late. WikiLeaks said Domscheit-Berg had "sabotaged years of work, none of which was his own" and the cost of rebuilding would ultimately be borne by supporters, many of whom "fight to keep our operations afloat with contributions of twenty dollars a month or less".</p>

<p>Clearly the loss of this leaked material was a huge calamity. But things quickly got even worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 25 August 2011 German newspaper Der Freitag <a href="https://www.freitag.de/autoren/steffen-kraft/leck-bei-wikileaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> (English translation <a href="https://www-freitag-de.translate.goog/autoren/steffen-kraft/leck-bei-wikileaks?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) that they were in possession of a 1.73 Gb "cables.csv" archive of Cablegate files. Thanks to the Guardian&#8217;s February 2010 book by David Leigh and Luke Harding, they also knew the decryption password to unlock it, although they could not confirm if this was the complete unredacted archive. Freitag noted that Julian Assange had contacted their editor Jakob Augstein a week earlier, warning him not to endanger lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks had also <a href="https://youtu.be/57Hqfq0rwXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telephoned</a> the White House to warn them of the impending release, saying Julian Assange wanted to speak to Hillary Clinton. But they were unable to get past junior officials:</p>

<p>"G&#8217;day Chad. This is Julian Assange. To try to make it clear: we don&#8217;t have a problem, you have a problem. We are trying to help you solve your problem because we are indirectly connected to your problem."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Der Freitag reported that in late 2010, after Daniel Domscheit-Berg and others had departed WikiLeaks, a copy of the Cablegate archive was entrusted to CCC&#8217;s Andy Müller-Maguhn, who had been secretly trying to mediate the return of "stolen" data. The encrypted "cables.csv" file was posted on a public BitTorrent download site soon afterwards, although Der Freitag could not say who did this (those in the know later cited "well-intentioned WikiLeaks supporters").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case <strong>somebody</strong> had clearly told Der Freitag - who had a <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business partnership</a> with the Guardian and were now working with Domscheit-Berg on the "test phase" of his new OpenLeaks project - where to find the archive.</p>
</div>

<p>Ominously, Der Freitag were not the only people who knew where to find the archive and how to open it. Word was spreading quickly. Der Spiegel <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/leak-at-wikileaks-a-dispatch-disaster-in-six-acts-a-783778.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that "in an effort to prove that Assange couldn&#8217;t be trusted, people associated with the OpenLeaks project recently began talking about the hidden diplomatic cables". By 30 August former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley was telling Associated Press that “any autocratic security service worth its salt” would probably already have the complete unredacted archive.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the word "downloaded": because the archive had been posted on a decentralised BitTorrent site, thousands of WikiLeaks supporters around the world would have already downloaded the full encrypted archive AND ALSO UPLOADED IT TO OTHERS without anyone ever realising they could open it with the help of the Guardian book. An anonymous Twitter account @Nin_99 had noticed that Der Spiegel said the archive was in a hidden sub-directory and pointed Parry to: 'http://193.198.207.6/wiki/file/xyz/'</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the directory, date-stamped 9 June 2010, were 4 files, all encoded with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encoding, the files names with '*.gpg' suffixes.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian also posted a rather bizarre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/unredacted-us-embassy-cables-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>, claiming it was "nonsense to suggest the Guardian&#8217;s WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Our book about WikiLeaks was published last February. It contained a password, but no details of the location of the files, and we were told it was a temporary password which would expire and be deleted in a matter of hours. It was a meaningless piece of information to anyone except the person(s) who created the database.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"No concerns were expressed when the book was published and if anyone at WikiLeaks had thought this compromised security they have had seven months to remove the files. That they didn&#8217;t do so clearly shows the problem was not caused by the Guardian&#8217;s book."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But of course the publication of the decryption password had self-evidently compromised security: as soon as the Guardian&#8217;s rushed-out book was published it became impossible to somehow make Assange&#8217;s elaborate passphrase secret again; it was not WikiLeaks who posted the archive on a torrents site, so they could neither remove nor edit it; and even if they could, the archive had quickly spread to countless users' computers around the world, who now only needed the Guardian&#8217;s book to unlock it. As mentioned in <a href="https://jaraparilla.xyz/ch9.html">Chapter 9</a>, Assange vehemently denied telling Leigh the password was temporary: it was the secure server which was temporary, as even the Guardian book itself stated. And as a cryptography expert <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1307953682755985413.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> years later, the encryption key could not be changed without re-encrypting the whole archive file. The Guardian&#8217;s criticism was absurd.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks staff were now facing another urgent moral dilemma: as governments and other powerful entities around the world now had access to the full unredacted Cablegate archive, shouldn&#8217;t all those whose names appeared in the US cables also have full access, so that they could read what was said about them and prepare for any possible repercussions? Wikileaks decided to ask their Twitter followers to vote on whether they supported the publication of the unredacted cables. The response was an overwhelming "YES".</p>

That’s because many of those condemning WikiLeaks care nothing about harm to civilians as long as it’s done by the U.S. government and military; indeed, such acts are endemic to the American wars they routinely cheer on.  What they actually hate is transparency and exposure of wrongdoing by their government; “risk to civilians” is just the pretext for attacking those, such as WikiLeaks, who bring that about&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>“Once WikiLeaks realized what had happened, they notified the State Department, but faced a quandary: virtually every government’s intelligence agencies would have had access to these documents as a result of these events, but the rest of the world — including journalists, whistleblowers and activists identified in the documents — did not.  At that point, WikiLeaks decided — quite reasonably — that the best and safest course was to release all the cables in full, so that not only the world’s intelligence agencies but everyone had them, so that steps could be taken to protect the sources and so that the information in them was equally available.”</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A handful of people knew of the existence of this republished file and, realising its potential for harm, they did not publish any clues as to how it might be accessed.

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was clearly unhinged nonsense. Desperate to avoid blame, the Guardian editors then claimed WikiLeaks had "dwindled to being the vehicle of one flawed individual – occasionally brilliant, but increasingly volatile and erratic."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was no compelling need, even with the recent disclosures of the internal leak, for WikiLeaks to publish all the material in the form in which it did. Julian Assange took a clear decision this week: he must take the responsibility for that.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange later told <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20869-assange-why-wikileaks-was-right-to-release-raw-cables/#ixzz6FBNyjXTu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Scientist</a> that WikiLeaks’ usual editorial “harm minimisation” procedures became irrelevant after other websites published the full unredacted cables. He said the public needed a reliable source for the cables and WikiLeaks had become a "trusted brand" for such material. He also blamed the Guardian for exposing "our internal security mechanisms” by publishing the lengthy passphrase:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if the passphrase had expired – it hadn’t in this case – the way it is put together, alongside knowledge of the use of an additional word, gives an attacker very strong clues as to how an organisation habitually structures its keys, passwords or passphrases.</p>

<p>Goran Rudling <a href="https://rixstep.com/2/20131001,00.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that David Leigh and his Guardian colleagues may have deliberately confused the terms "password" and "encryption key". This book has used the term "password" or "passphrase" above because it was widely quoted as such but it is important to understand the distinction: an encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt a file, whereas a password just provides access. If you access an encypted file but don&#8217;t have the key, all you will see is random characters (i.e. gibberish). Rudling also has an interesting <a href="https://rixstep.com/1/20110829,00.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timeline</a> of Domscheit-Berg&#8217;s involvement with WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>I have seen a human side of him that hasn’t been represented in the press. He is incredibly popular with my children, who see him as sort of an uncle figure. He’s somebody who will listen to you, and he’s somebody who will give you time and give you attention and help you&#8230;&#8203; He’s damn good company.</p>

<p>Smith also ridiculed media claims that the much-vaunted "age of WikiLeaks" was already over.</p>

<p>I think there are lots of bullies here. I think the British press have been bullying. I think the American government have been bullies. But it’s wider than that&#8230;&#8203; Julian is presented as some sort of slightly nutty proponent of radical transparency. Actually, the truth is, he isn’t anything of the sort.</p>

<p>I think it would be foolish to determine WikiLeaks is over. It’s far too premature for that&#8230;&#8203; I don’t think we’ve seen the end of Assange.</p>

<p>On 6 November Jennifer Robinson and Julian Assange published an <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/play-ball-not-bolt-in-free-speech-debate-20111027-1mm4h.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> in the Sydney Morning Herald criticizing Australia&#8217;s "hate speech" laws. Many supporters were <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flustered</a> by Assange&#8217;s decision to defend Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s rightwing News Limited columnist Andrew Bolt, who had previously called Assange a "patronising, supercilious racist git". Ironically, Bolt had just been convicted for publishing racial slurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Citing the USA&#8217;s First Amendment, Robinson and Assange argued that the state should not be allowed to regulate what political speech is deemed acceptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In much of Europe and Australia, it is unlawful to deny that the Holocaust took place - this is "acceptable" censorship. But in Turkey it is a crime to assert that the Armenians were subjected to genocide. Imagine if Australia introduced a law prohibiting use of the word "genocide" in respect of the treatment of indigenous Australians? &#8230;&#8203;</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free speech must protect all speech, however offensive. Debates that offend the "ordinary" or "typical" Australian are precisely the debates we need. It is precisely when the majority shares a view that it needs to be challenged, because if it is wrong, then we are all imperiled.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that Assange was himself facing years in jail if extradited to the USA, his comments reflected deep personal convictions:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The law, whether civil or criminal, is a serious business. At its end is the deployment of armed police to imprison people or seize their assets by force. It should never be used to regulate disfavoured views.</p>

<p>On 17 November 2011 US President Barack Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/17/remarks-president-obama-australian-parliament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed</a> the Australian Parliament and announced an increase in military co-operation, including a permanent rotational force of 2,500 US Marines at a new base outside Darwin.

<p>On the lawns outside Parliament House, hundreds of <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2354" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protestors</a> chanted: "Assange and Manning! Let them go! The people have the right to know!" Julian Assange&#8217;s mother Christine Assange addressed the crowd, <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a> "the Australian government has done nothing for Julian” and condemning the "star-stuck" attitude of Australian politicians. After thanking supporters and urging them to “continue fighting for my son” she told <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/International/2011/Nov-18/154456-assanges&#8212;&#8203;mother-calls&#8212;&#8203;for-australian&#8212;&#8203;intervention.ashx#axzz1e0kes59O" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media</a> that the USA should accept blame for the “lax security” which had lead to the release of their secret documents through WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>"The Walkleys" are the most prestigious awards in Australian journalism. On 27 November 2011 the Walkley Foundation <a href="https://www.walkleys.com/awards/walkley-winners-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that WikiLeaks had won the Walkley Award for "Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism". Judges said Wikileaks applied new technology to “penetrate the inner workings of government to reveal an avalanche of inconvenient truths in a global publishing coup”.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/julian-assange-people-want-truth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acceptance speech</a> Assange said the work of WikiLeaks had created a lot of powerful enemies but also good friends: "it has brought out the best in people: courage, loyalty, compassion and strength".</p>

<p>Our lives have been threatened, attempts have been made to censor us, banks have attempted to shut off our financial lifeline.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Powerful enemies are testing the water to see how much they can get away with, seeing how they can abuse the system that they’ve integrated with to prevent scrutiny. Well, the answer is: they can get away with too much. I expected the hate-speech on Fox News, but not the calls by US Senators for the extra-judicial assassination of myself and my staff. Neither did I expect that the United States would aggressively undermine its own constitution to persecute me and my organisation. But I can understand the Washington elites’ reaction. Washington is waging a war against the truth. It was, after all, the truth about Washington and its friends that we revealed.</p>

<p>What I cannot understand is the craven behaviour of the Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It is embarrassing.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A year earlier, Assange reminded the crowded room full of journalists, Gillard had commissioned "an absurd, whole-of-government task force" and "falsely stated that WikiLeaks had acted illegally" - the Australian Federal Police "had to take the embarrassing role of correcting her". The Attorney General had decided not to cancel Assange&#8217;s passport, "saying not that it was wrong, but that it was helpful for tracing my movements". And when Assange was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize, the Australian High Commission in London had refused to host the event.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Australian government has refused to say whether it would block my extradition to the United States from Australia, but it has acknowledged that it has the political discretion to do so. The Gillard government has shown its true colours in relation to how it has handled US pressure on WikiLeaks&#8230;&#8203;</p>
