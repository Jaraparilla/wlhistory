<p>On 12 April WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared on Australia&#8217;s primetime <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2011/s3188451.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7:30 Report</a>. Host Leigh Sales suggested it must feel "unreal" to come from "sleeping rough on the streets of Melbourne" to global celebrity status.</p>

<p>At a U.C.

<p>Assange noted that the Times had gone to extreme lengths to pretend there was no collaboration with WikiLeaks - even pressing for Wikileaks to publish documents before it did - in case they were accused of violating the Espionage Act.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That&#8217;s why The New York Times is careful to say this was not a collaboration. What the Times is afraid of is that one man&#8217;s collaboration is another man&#8217;s conspiracy."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A week later Britain&#8217;s The Guardian was named UK Newspaper Of The Year for their work with WikiLeaks. Why didn&#8217;t the New York Times also win a Pulitzer for their coverage? According to <a href="http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/60439531693948928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiLeaks</a> they were "too timid to nominate".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By our count, on 54 days so far this year, the paper&#8217;s reporters have relied on WikiLeaks documents as sources for their stories. Since April 25th is the 115th day of the year, that&#8217;s nearly half of all their issues this year. And just to be clear, we didn&#8217;t count stories that merely mentioned WikiLeaks or Julian Assange or Bradley Manning, only the ones that used documents from the site as a reporting source.</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 24-country poll found that most people believe WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange is not a criminal and should not be charged by the U.S. government for releasing thousands of secret U.S. documents. The poll by Ipsos found 79 percent of people were aware of WikiLeaks and two-thirds of those believed Assange should not be charged and three-quarters supported the group&#8217;s bid to make public secret government or corporate documents.</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>U.S. respondents had a far more critical view, with 81 percent aware of WikiLeaks and 69 percent of those believing Assange should be charged and 61 percent opposing WikiLeaks' mission.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

In addition, 73% of them "expressed a lack of confidence in governments’ ability to prevent future data leaks". Nevertheless, 64% of all those surveyed wanted WikiLeaks shut down.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>And in Sweden, a poll of 9,000 lawyers found nearly a third of them <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20110505/33604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> with Julian Assange&#8217;s criticisms of the Swedish legal system:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“We’re of the opinion that remand in Sweden is used in a way that many other states governed by the rule of law would find unfamiliar&#8230;&#8203; The system is built up so that, in principal, the suspect doesn’t have any insight into the preliminary investigation."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 21 April 2011 a group of disillusioned Obama voters paid $76,000 for tickets to a fundraiser where they cornered the President, <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/a-76000-obama-protest-song/1914828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sang him a song</a>, and then asked about the treatment of Chelsea Manning. While Manning still had not been given a trial, the US Commander-In-Chief was caught on video saying that Manning "broke the law". Obama also said “it wasn’t the same thing” as what Daniel Ellsberg had done with the Pentagon Papers because the information “wasn’t classified in the same way.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A White House spokesman later <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> that Obama was "expressing a view as to the guilt or innocence of Pfc. Manning specifically". But clearly any chance of a fair trial had been prejudiced. Meanwhile both Manning and Assange were <a href="http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/57237967332311040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racing up the charts</a> in TIME magazine&#8217;s annual "most influential people" poll.</p>

<p>On 25 April 2011 WikiLeaks released "<a href="http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guantánamo Files</a>".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In thousands of pages of documents dating from 2002 to 2008 and never seen before by members of the public or the media, the cases of the majority of the prisoners held at Guantánamo — 765 out of 779 in total — are described in detail in memoranda from JTF-GTMO, the Joint Task Force at Guantánamo Bay, to US Southern Command in Miami, Florida.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These memoranda, known as Detainee Assessment Briefs (DABs), contain JTF-GTMO’s recommendations about whether the prisoners in question should continue to be held, or should be released (transferred to their home governments, or to other governments). They consist of a wealth of important and previously undisclosed information, including health assessments, for example, and, in the cases of the majority of the 172 prisoners who are still held, photos (mostly for the first time ever).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They also include information on the first 201 prisoners released from the prison, between 2002 and 2004, which, unlike information on the rest of the prisoners (summaries of evidence and tribunal transcripts, released as the result of a lawsuit filed by media groups in 2006), has never been made public before. Most of these documents reveal accounts of incompetence familiar to those who have studied Guantánamo closely, with innocent men detained by mistake (or because the US was offering substantial bounties to its allies for al-Qaeda or Taliban suspects), and numerous insignificant Taliban conscripts from Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond these previously unknown cases, the documents also reveal stories of the 399 other prisoners released from September 2004 to the present day, and of the seven men who have died at the prison.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Gitmo Files provided further compelling evidence that the US military&#8217;s torture facility in Cuba had quickly degenerated into a cruel and pointless farce. Officials did not know why prisoners had been brought to them, or what to do with them. In 704 leaked documents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110429012532/https://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/04/24/wikileaks-7-shocking-gitmo-revelations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assessed</a> by the New York Times, the word "possibly" appeared 387 times, “unknown” 188 times and “deceptive” 85 times. The US Department of Defence had set up two committees at the prison who persistently argued with each other about how to classify prisoners and information. A handful of prisoners had turned informants under torture and were willing to say anything about other prisoners, leading to countless false accusations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some "high risk" prisoners had been released and quickly returned to terrorism, while there was no proof that many others were guilty of any crime at all. Some were only arrested because they wore a cheap old <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/af/us9af-000008dp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casio model</a> of watch which the US military claimed could be used as a timer for bombs.

One was an alleged bodyguard of Osama bin Laden who the USA had secretly allowed to go home to Morocco. Another was a self-described spy for the CIA in Kabul, and then in Guantánamo Bay, where he was treated like all the other prisoners but was never able to provide any useful information on them.</p>

<p>The UK Telegraph was also <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticised</a> for creating a searchable database of prisoners which listed fifteen detainees who remained at the facility as "Terrorists" - even though they had not been given a fair trial.

<p>On the same day Bin Laden was killed, Russia Today published a wide-ranging <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/wikileaks-revelations-assange-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Julian Assange, who said Guantánamo Bay was set up to hide people and to "keep them outside of the law".

<p>"We only released secret, classified, confidential material. We didn’t have any top secret cables. The really embarrassing stuff, the really serious stuff wasn’t in our collection to release. But it is still out there.”</p>

<p>Asked about "cable cooking" - a common complaint from readers whereby media organisations over-redacted cables to protect businesses and others who deserved to be exposed - Assange was furious:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The New York Times redacted a 62-page cable down to two paragraphs. And this is completely against the agreement that we originally set up with them on November 1, 2010.

There should be no other redaction, not to protect reputation, not to protect The Guardian&#8217;s profits, but only to protect lives."</p>

Facebook, Google, Yahoo – all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces for US intelligence. It’s not a matter of serving a subpoena.

It&#8217;s only when you start to understand that you can make effective decisions and effective plans. Now, the question is, who is promoting ignorance? Well, those organizations that try to keep things secret, and those organizations which distort true information to make it false or misrepresentative. In this latter category, it is bad media. It really is my opinion that media in general are so bad that we have to question whether the world wouldn&#8217;t be better off without them altogether. They are so distortive to how the world actually is that the result is&#8230;&#8203; we see wars, and we see corrupt governments continue on. One of the hopeful things that I’ve discovered is that nearly every war that has started in the past 50 years has been a result of media lies. The media could&#8217;ve stopped it if they had searched deep enough; if they hadn&#8217;t reprinted government propaganda they could&#8217;ve stopped it. But what does that mean? Well, that means that basically populations don&#8217;t like wars, and populations have to be fooled into wars. Populations don&#8217;t willingly, with open eyes, go into a war. So if we have a good media environment, then we also have a peaceful environment.</p>

<p>Japanese government officials were never committed to relocating the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma outside of Okinawa Prefecture&#8230;&#8203;.

<p>In early May 2011, Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s Wall Street Journal paid WikiLeaks the ultimate compliment by <a href="https://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/wsjs-safehouse-for-anonymous-wall-street-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> their own copycat "secure" anonymous online dropbox named <a href="https://www.wsjsafehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SafeHouse</a> (spoiler: it was a ridiculous failure and no longer exists).</p>

The terms and conditions included a disclaimer that the site "cannot ensure complete anonymity" of whistleblowers and recommends "cloaking" tools such as Tor.

<p>WikiLeaks <a href="http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/66308535037865984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ridiculed</a> the idea that a corporate newspaper could launch such a site while simultaneously <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703387904576278883412892972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanding</a> the indictment of Julian Assange. They <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/wikileaks/status/66926919651823616" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to Assange&#8217;s previous comments about mainstream journalists lacking the technical knowledge to protect online sources, and also lacking the courage to protect whistle-blowers.</p>

<p>Media attacks kept coming. Even the USA&#8217;s non-profit Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) took aim at WikiLeaks, with a Frontline documentatry titled "WikiSecrets". The primetime TV show featured hostile quotes from figures like Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Adrian Lamo, David Leigh, and the New York Time&#8217;s Bill Keller and Eric Schmitt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hours before the program went to air on 24 May 2011, WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/WikiSecrets-Julian-Assange-Full.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a full transcript of the "behind the scenes interview tape between Julian Assange &amp; PBS Frontline&#8217;s Martin Smith". This was followed by "correspondence between PBS and WikiLeaks as to the ethics of this interview".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A source within PBS told us that Frontline would attempt to embroil Julian Assange and Bradley Manning in an espionage context. Frontline assured us this was not what the documentary would show and that the two men&#8217;s stories would not be connected.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The show included a quote from Eric Schmitt speculating on a possible intermediary between Assange and Manning, with producers suggesting that person could be "a member of the Boston community&#8230;&#8203; subpoenaed by the Grand Jury" (i.e. David House: see below). WikiLeaks Central <a href="http://wlcentral.org/node/1811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that the documentary "overplayed Manning’s homosexuality" and Assange didn’t get ample time to speak: "the problem is that every time he was asked a question it was about a criticism, which forced him to be on the defensive." Sympathetic figures like Vaughan Smith, who were also interviewed for the sure, were edited out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Greg Mitchell from The Nation later <a href="https://boingboing.net/2011/05/24/frontline-on-wikilea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> the program as "nothing but re-hash" of news reports going back to June 2010:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"One of the only bits of new information in the much-ballyhooded PBS Frontline program on WikiLeaks, Assange and Bradley Manning which aired tonight was: the man who fingered Manning, Adrian Lamo, secluded in California, has a large goldfish in his apartment."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the program finished, angry hackers defaced the PBS website, posting a fake story that dead rapper Tupac had been found alive and well in a small resort in New Zealand, living with another dead rapper, Biggie Smalls. Thousands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627060612/http://blogs.forbes.com/parmyolson/2011/05/30/thousands-like-fake-tupac-story-posted-by-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liked</a> the story on Facebook while Twitter users began eagerly speculating if it could be true. The hackers also posted a list of usernames and passwords for PBS I.T. admins and users, along with login details for local PBS television stations.</p>

<p>On 15 June 2011, David House, the co-founder of the "Bradley Manning Support Network", appeared before the WikiLeaks Grand Jury in Alexandria, Virginia. House, who had previously been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101112030326/https://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/11/09/manning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassed</a> by US government agents after visiting Manning three times at Quantico, invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. He later released a <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> demanding the Department of Justice&#8217;s cease their "politically motivated harassment".</p>

<p>The show trial that is now underway in Alexandria VA has the potential to set a dangerous precedent for regulating the media. Using Nixonian fear tactics that were honed during the Pentagon Papers investigation, the DoJ is attempting to dismantle a major media organization - WikiLeaks — and indict its editor, Julian Assange. The DoJ&#8217;s ever-widening net has now come to encompass academics, students, and journalists in the Cambridge area.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>House said the Obama administration was trying to force him and other individuals to testify against WikiLeaks in order to criminalise its publications. Supporters in the Greater Boston area were being <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1888" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> "Do you or have you ever worked for WikiLeaks?" - a chilling reminder of the McCarthyist anti-Communist hysteria.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that there were only two other federal Grand Juries active in the USA; one investigating the #Anonymous “hacktivist” group, the other targeting antiwar, labor and international solidarity activists. NPR&#8217;s Carrie Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514051502/https://www.npr.org/2011/05/11/136173262/case-against-wikileaks-part-of-broader-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the WikiLeaks Grand Jury was "part of a much broader campaign by the Obama administration to crack down on leakers".</p>

<p>On 3 July 2011, Julian Assange celebrated his 40th birthday with a large gathering of friends and supporters at Elligham Hall. The WikiLeaks Editor-In-Chief, who was still wearing an ankle bracelet that tracked his every movement, including his daily trips to the local police station, had now been under house arrest for over six months. By this time, US intelligence officials were secretly <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/18/discovery-sigint-targeting-scenarios-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plotting</a> to designate WikiLeaks as “a ‘malicious foreign actor’ for the purpose of targeting.” This would allow them to target WikiLeaks and associates - including US citizens - with extensive electronic surveillance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a tongue-in-cheeck publicity stunt, and in the hope of garnering more high profile supporters, Assange <a href="https://www.gawker.com/5820182/heres-the-invite-to-julian-assanges-40th-birthday-blowout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> birthday invitations (complete with directions for private jets and helicopters) to Hollywood celebrities like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Former UK Ambassador Craig Murray, who became a close friend of Julian&#8217;s, was <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2011/07/celebrity-dissent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not impressed</a>:</p>

<p>In fact they never even responded. The party featured an auction of donations to raise funds for Assange&#8217;s legal expenses, with personal bids establishing a reserve price before items went on Ebay. A week earlier, UK media had reported that a $1.5 million deal for Assange&#8217;s biography had fallen through, and WikiLeaks donations were being funneled into the Julian Assange Defense Fund.</p>

<p>A week later, Assange&#8217;s lawyers launched a fresh appeal against his extradition at the High Court in London. At his first appeal to the Westminster Magistrates Court in February, the judge had dismissed claims that he would not get a fair trial in Sweden, and that the extradition attempt was politically motivated. When Assange again lost this expensive appeal to the High Court, after four months of deliberation, his last British legal resort would be an even more expensive appeal to the UK&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond that, his final avenue of appeal would be to the European courts, where his legal team remained optimistic; many supportive European MPs had already <a href="https://usave.co.uk/2011/6/9/european-meps-slam-assange-extradition-warrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condemned</a> Sweden&#8217;s abuse of the "imperfect" European Arrest Warrant processes.</p>
