<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early 2011 saw the US government stepping up multiple attacks on WikiLeaks, despite continuing widespread public support for the brave whistle-blowing publishers. Meanwhile, former media partners were quickly turning into hostile critics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this stage, many observers (including <a href="https://jaraparilla.blogspot.com/2011/09/thoughts-on-assange-and-aspergers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myself</a>) were beginning to wonder if Julian Assange might have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Aspergers Syndrome</a>. He brushed away such suggestions as unimportant but was later <a href="https://shadowproof.com/2020/09/23/doctor-assange-aspergers-prison-extradition-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosed</a> with the condition. People with Aspergers Syndrome are on the high-functioning end of the Autism Spectrum and often extremely intelligent. They are sometimes accused of lacking empathy when in fact they may just be lacking certain social skills, and they can often become obsessed with certain topics. Giveaway symptoms for Assange included his long, rambling, monotone speeches, his fearless approach to public criticism, and his frequent capacity to infuriate people around him with his single-minded determination.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bank_of_america">Bank of America</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 30 November 2010, a day after the Cablegate release, shares in Bank of America <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101203000437/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3029371820101130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dived</a> by 3 percent as rumours spread that it would be the target of WikiLeaks' next big release.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Monday, Julian Assange, founder of the WikiLeaks, said his group plans to release tens of thousands of internal documents from a major U.S. bank early next year, according to an interview posted online by Forbes Magazine.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interviewed in Malaysia a year earlier, Assange had told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609225139/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9139180/Wikileaks_plans_to_make_the_Web_a_leakier_place" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDG News Service</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"At the moment, for example, we are sitting on 5GB from Bank of America, one of the executive’s hard drives&#8230;&#8203; Now how do we present that? It’s a difficult problem. We could just dump it all into one giant Zip file, but we know for a fact that has limited impact. To have impact, it needs to be easy for people to dive in and search it and get something out of it."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same interview, Assange revealed how WikiLeaks had learned from lack of media coverage in previous leaks:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"It&#8217;s counterintuitive," he said. "You&#8217;d think the bigger and more important the document is, the more likely it will be reported on but that&#8217;s absolutely not true. It&#8217;s about supply and demand. Zero supply equals high demand, it has value. As soon as we release the material, the supply goes to infinity, so the perceived value goes to zero."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He said WikiLeaks wanted to "get as much substantive information as possible into the historical record, keep it accessible, and provide incentives for people to turn it into something that will achieve political reform."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Cablegate release had done just that. And in response to Senator Joe Lieberman&#8217;s call, Bank of America executives were now keen to take proactive action. They did not know that - thanks to "disgruntled former employees" - WikiLeaks was no longer even in possession of their hard drive data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virginia-based law firm Hunton &amp; Williams (H&amp;W) had an unprofitable data intelligence project called Team Themis, which was close to being folded in early December 2010 when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/the-ridiculous-plan-to-attack-wikileaks/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suddenly</a> they got an "urgent request" from "a major US bank" that was "seeking help against WikiLeaks".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I need a favor. I need five to six slides on Wikileaks — who they are, how they operate and how this group may help this bank. Please advise if you can help get me something ASAP. My call is at noon"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Team Themis included staff from Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies, and HBGary Federal, whose CEO Aaron Barr rushed out a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222164859/http://wikileaks.ch/IMG/pdf/WikiLeaks_Response_v6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerPoint presentation</a> that called for "disinformation", "cyber attacks" and a "media campaign" against WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>A former Navy Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) officer, Aaron Barr insisted that US civil rights lawyer and journalist Glenn Greenwald was a critical target:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"It is this level of support we need to attack. These are established professionals that have a liberal bent, but ultimately most of them if pushed will choose professional preservation over cause, such is the mentality of most business professionals. Without the support of people like Glenn WikiLeaks would fold."</p>

<p>In January 2011 a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092707/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/business/03wikileaks-bank.html?_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times article</a> confirmed that the Bank of America&#8217;s "counterespionage work" against WikiLeaks entailed constant briefings for top executives and the hiring of "several top law firms".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But in Febraury 2011 Aaron Barr went a step too far, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092707/http://www.v3.co.uk/v3/news/2274613/anonymous-hbgary-federal-ft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasting</a> to the Financial Times that his firm HB Gary Federal was about to expose #Anonymous hackers. In retaliation, #Anonymous hacked into HB Gary&#8217;s email accounts and published 50,000 of their emails online. They also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/anonymous-speaks-the-inside-story-of-the-hbgary-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked</a> Barr&#8217;s Twitter and other online accounts. Thus the secret Powerpoint slides of "Team Themis" (above) were publicly exposed. The emails also suggested that Team Themis had been set up at the request of the Chamber of Commerce to infiltrate ThinkProgress and other pro-Union groups.</p>

<p>As Glenn Greenwald <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092707/https://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/02/11/campaigns/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>, based on the poor quality of their research and seemingly illegal proposals, Team Themis at first looked like "just some self-promoting, fly-by-night entities of little significance". But "the firms involved here are large, legitimate and serious, and do substantial amounts of work for both the U.S. Government and the nation&#8217;s largest private corporations". HBGary claimed to have a cache of "zero-day exploits" - cyber attacks for which there is no existing remedy - and expertise in "computer network attack", "custom malware development" and "persistent software implants."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And perhaps most disturbing of all, Hunton &amp; Williams was recommended to Bank of America&#8217;s General Counsel by the Justice Department&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;meaning the U.S. Government is aiding Bank of America in its defense against/attacks on WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Greenwald said the episode highlighted "just how lawless and unrestrained is the unified axis of government and corporate power".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The firms the Bank has hired (such as Booz Allen) are suffused with the highest level former defense and intelligence officials, while these other outside firms (including Hunton &amp; Williams and Palantir) are extremely well-connected to the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government&#8217;s obsession with destroying WikiLeaks has been well-documented.  And because the U.S. Government is free to break the law without any constraints, oversight or accountability, so, too, are its "private partners" able to act lawlessly&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to imagine the DOJ ever, ever prosecuting a huge entity like Bank of America for doing something like waging war against WikiLeaks and its supporters.  These massive corporations and the firms that serve them have no fear of law or government because they control each.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bank of America issued a "carefully worded statement". H &amp; W refused to comment. Palantir publicly apologized "to progressive organizations in general, and Mr. Greenwald in particular, for any involvement that we may have had in these matters". HBGary distanced themselves from Aaron Barr, who resigned, and HBGary Federal was folded.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were also <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2011/01/25/wikileaks-hackers-and-conspiracy-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily dismissed</a> claims that WikiLeaks had acquired their files by hacking. Sadly, even WikiLeaks' trusted media partners were guilty of indulging these deliberate smears and outright lies, with British newspaper the Guardian quickly becoming the most hostile organisation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The very idea of media partnerships had first been conceived when Julian Assange met with Guardian journalist Nick Davies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/wikileaks-war-logs-back-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a Brussels cafe</a>. But on 17 December 2010, Davies published an article titled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden">Ten Days In Sweden</a>, which provided lurid details of the Swedish sex allegations directly from the Swedish police file on the Assange case. Davies said the file, which would normally have remained secret to protect the privacy of all parties concerned, just "happened to make its way quite legitimately into the hands of somebody I have come across in the past". He refused to identify his source, who almost certainly committed a crime by leaking the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Guy Rundle later read the full police report in Swedish and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130809042529/https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2011/march/1346725054/guy-rundle/crayfish-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> "Davies has fundamentally distorted the record" with key details omitted and "distortingly oversimplified translation".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And of all Nick Davies’ omissions, perhaps the most significant was that of the final witness, who was questioned about text messages she exchanged with Sofia Wilén discussing seeking revenge on Assange, and getting money from newspapers (“it was just a joke”).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first week of January 2011, Bianca Jagger (who had helped pay Julian Assange&#8217;s bail) published a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-julian-assange-trial_b_805299">rebuttal</a> of Nick Davies' <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_1506_b_802680">rebuttal</a> of her <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trial-by-newspaper_b_800847">rebuttal</a> of his original "Ten Days In Sweden" article. Davies, who acknowledged having fallen out with Assange months earlier, had rejected Jagger&#8217;s claims that his one-sided article, peppered with lurid sexual details, amounted to "trial by newspapers".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jagger dismissed Davies' ludicrous claim that he was defending his source just like WikiLeaks defended theirs, noting "there is a profound difference between exposing the deeds of powerful governments, corporations and the rich and throwing mud at those who released the information". She also made an important point which would have profound repercussions for years to come:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange cannot defend himself at this point; all he can do is refute these allegations in the broadest terms. Davies knows that Assange’s lawyers will insist that he does not publicly engage in a rebuttal of the details in these allegations himself, when he is facing extradition and possible criminal charges. He is thoroughly disadvantaged by what Davies has done.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Davies eventually washed his hands of any responsibility for the article that bore his name:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reality is that I didn’t write the story which the Guardian published. The copy which I filed was completely re-written in the Guardian office, a commonplace event in a newsroom.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the Guardian&#8217;s animosity to Assange continued. On 3 January 2011 the Guardian published an article that accused WikiLeaks of endangering the life of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the democratic opposition in Zimbabwe, by publishing a cable about him. The author James Richardson, a US Republican working for a "social media public affairs agency" (not disclosed to readers), argued that "WikiLeaks may have committed its own collateral murder."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"WikiLeaks ought to leave international relations to those who understand it – at least to those who understand the value of a life."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a major problem with this claim: it was the Guardian themselves who had selected the cable from the archive and chosen to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/241595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publish</a> it in early December. Nevertheless, the false claim was repeated in the Wall Street Journal, the Atlantic, Politico and other sites. It took over a week for the Guardian to publish a footnote:</p>

<p>But as Glenn Greenwald <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110115093958/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/12/propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>, the article - which should have been deleted - was not fundamentally altered. The misleading headline remained, along with repeated false claims blaming WikiLeaks for publishing the cable.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the propaganda campaign - created by the U.S. Government and (as always) bolstered by the American media - which is being used to justify WikiLeaks' destruction (and, with it, the repression of some of the most promising avenues for transparency and investigative journalism we&#8217;ve seen in many years)&#8230;&#8203; WikiLeaks didn&#8217;t steal anything.  They didn&#8217;t break any laws.  They did what newspapers do every day, what investigative journalism does at its core:  expose secret, corrupt actions of those in power.  And the attempt to criminalize WikiLeaks is thus nothing less than a full frontal assault on press and Internet freedoms.</p>

<p>On 11 January 2011 Julian Assange&#8217;s routine case management hearing at Belmarsh Magistrates Court was swamped with media and supporters. The Guardian&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2011/jan/11/wikileaks-latest-developments">live-blog</a> of the event included continuing global fallout from the US cable publications and highlights from a 35-page <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/902">skeleton outline</a> of court arguments from Assange&#8217;s lawyers.</p>

<p>There were valid security concerns around Assange&#8217;s court appearance, especially following a recent mass shooting in Arizona where a US politician was shot. WikiLeaks published a <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/82g3kb">statement</a> condemning violent threats:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks staff and contributors have also been the target of unprecedented violent rhetoric by US prominent media personalities, including Sarah Palin, who urged the US administration to “Hunt down the WikiLeaks chief like the Taliban”.

US radio personality Rush Limbaugh has called for pressure to "Give [Fox News President Roger] Ailes the order and [then] there is no Assange, I&#8217;ll guarantee you, and there will be no fingerprints on it.", while the Washington Times columnist Jeffery T. Kuhner titled his column “Assassinate Assange” captioned with a picture Julian Assange overlayed with a gun site, blood spatters, and “WANTED DEAD or ALIVE” with the alive crossed out.</p>

Those who call for an act of murder deserve as significant share of the guilt as those raising a gun to pull the trigger."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A website addresss, JulianAssangeMustDie.com, was traced to a rightwing US blogger (and deleted soon afterwards).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile the economic threats from US officials continued to escalate. On 12 January 2011 WikiLeaks <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/WIKILEAKS-PRESS-RELEASE.html">responded</a> to Rep. Peter T. King&#8217;s calls for a US embargo of WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks today condemned calls from the chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security to "strangle the viability" of WikiLeaks by placing the publisher and its editor-in-chief, Julian Assange, on a US "enemies list" normally reserved for terrorists and dictators.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>King specifically wanted to target Knopf, a New York publisher who had recently agreed to pay Assange for an autobiography. Assange said the book royalties would "keep Wikileaks afloat". An article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/blacklisting-wikileaks/69535/">the Atlantic</a> ridiculed the madness of such a McCarthyist blacklist: "you could conceivably break the law merely by buying his book, or contributing to a WikiLeaks defense fund".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks was under massive pressure but clearly not going down without a fight. In a 12 January <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/01/china-wikileaks-assange">interview</a> with John Pilger, Assange again mentioned the existence of "insurance files":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"WikiLeaks is now mirrored on more than 2,000 websites&#8230;&#8203; If something happens to me or to WikiLeaks, ‘insurance’ files will be released&#8230;&#8203;. There are 504 US embassy cables on one broadcasting organisation and there are cables on Murdoch and News Corp.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Was it a bluff? In years to come, WikiLeaks would repeatedly post such encrypted "insurance files" online. This lead to a lot of wild speculation about the contents, and much of that speculation eventually solidified into misguided belief. Uninformed critics still angrily disclaim how WikiLeaks "promised" to post something but never did.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 8 January 2011 WikiLeaks <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wikileaks/status/23591796542013441">launched</a> a new defense fund for Julian Assange, tweeting: "let us see Paypal try to close this one down too!"

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public protests for Assange and WikiLeaks always featured prominent support for Chelsea (then still "Bradley") Manning, who had now been jailed under turturous conditions at the Quantico brig for over five months. On 24 January, two Manning supporters (including regular visitor David House) were <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1063">turned away</a> from the facility after they attempted to deliver a petition of support with 42,000 signatures. On the following day, NBC reported that US military officials had placed Manning on suicide watch.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The official said that after Manning had allegedly failed to follow orders from his Marine guards, [Brig Commander James] Averhart declared Manning a "suicide risk." Manning was then placed on suicide watch, which meant he was confined to his cell, stripped of most of his clothing and deprived of his reading glasses — anything that Manning could use to harm himself.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manning later claimed that the guards had created a scene by issuing conflicting demands such as "turn left, don&#8217;t turn left". An investigation found that the Brig Commander had acted unlawfully, and he was replaced.</p>

Manning&#8217;s lawyers filed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233021/http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/01/article-138-complaint.html">complaint</a> explaining exactly what this status entailed:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like suicide risk, he is held in solitary confinement. For 23 hours per day, he will sit in his cell. The guards will check on him every five minutes by asking him if he is okay. PFC Manning will be required to respond in some affirmative manner. At night, if the guards cannot see him clearly, because he has a blanket over his head or is curled up towards the wall, they will wake him in order to ensure that he is okay. He will receive each of his meals in his cell. He will not be allowed to have a pillow or sheets. He will not be allowed to have any personal items in his cell. He will only be allowed to have one book or one magazine at any given time to read. The book or magazine will be taken away from him at the end of the day before he goes to sleep. He will be prevented from exercising in his cell. If he attempts to do push-ups, sit-ups, or any other form of exercise he will be forced to stop. He will receive one hour of exercise outside of his cell daily. The guards will take him to an empty room and allow him to walk. He will usually just walk in figure eights around the room until his hour is complete. When he goes to sleep, he will be required to strip down to his underwear and surrender his clothing to the guards.</p>

<p>Stratfor is a Texas-based security information business that relies on close communication with US intelligence agencies. Many Stratfor staff are former CIA agents. In early 2011, Stratfor&#8217;s Vice-President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security was Fred Burton, a former Deputy Chief of the Department of State&#8217;s counterterrorism division for the Diplomatic Security Service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 26 January 2011, Burton sent an email to Stratfor staff <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1352579_fw-ct-assange-manning-link-not-key-to-wikileaks-case-.html">revealing</a> that the US government now had "a sealed indictment on Assange". He asked staff to protect this information and not publish it.</p>

<p>Burton&#8217;s email remained secret until February 2012, when Stratfor was hacked by #Anonymous and WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Stratfor-Emails-US-Has-Issued.html">published</a> the <a href="http://wikileaks.org/the-gifiles.html">files</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Burton&#8217;s hacked emails also stated: "Assange is going to make a nice bride in prison. Screw the terrorist. He&#8217;ll be eating cat food forever." Like Palantir and HBGary&#8217;s Aaron Barr, he recommended destroying WikiLeaks' financial base and infrastructure using "the same tools used to dismantle and track" terrorists.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite this further evidence of a US indictment, media commentators and senior government officials in Britain, Australia, and Sweden - many of whom must also have known about the sealed indictment - continued to pretend that Assange&#8217;s fears of extradition to the USA were entirely baseless.</p>

<p>Keller was intent on establishing his own narrative of events, thus insulating his newspaper from allegations of irresponsible reporting. He dismissed Assange as "thin-skinned&#8230;&#8203; arrogant&#8230;&#8203; elusive, manipulative and volatile (and ultimately openly hostile to The Times and The Guardian)." But he also provided qualified support for WikiLeaks in the face of US government threats:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But while I do not regard Assange as a partner, and I would hesitate to describe what WikiLeaks does as journalism, it is chilling to contemplate the possible government prosecution of WikiLeaks for making secrets public, let alone the passage of new laws to punish the dissemination of classified information, as some have advocated. Taking legal recourse against a government official who violates his trust by divulging secrets he is sworn to protect is one thing. But criminalizing the publication of such secrets by someone who has no official obligation seems to me to run up against the First Amendment and the best traditions of this country.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Five days later, 60 Minutes aired a lengthy <a href="http://is.gd/7Ll9ZM">interview</a> with Assange where he claimed "our founding values are those of the U.S. revolution".</p>

<p>The Arab Spring saw many online activists joining the #Anonymous global collective to bring down government websites in the Middle East with massive Denial of Service (DDos) attacks.

<h3 id="_the_guardians_war_on_secrecy_book">The Guardian&#8217;s "War On Secrecy" Book</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the start of February 2011, barely two thousand of the 250,000 leaked cables had been published. But like the New York Times (above) Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding were already rushing out a book: "Wikileaks: Inside Julian Assange&#8217;s War on Secrecy". An excerpt from the Preface by their boss Alan Rusbridger was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/28/wikileaks-julian-assange-alan-rusbridger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> three days before the book&#8217;s release, mostly complaining about the difficulties of working with WikiLeaks' unconventional founder. The Guardian EIC approvingly quoted Slate columnist Jack Shafer:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Assange bedevils the journalists who work with him because he refuses to conform to any of the roles they expect him to play."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="waronsecrecy.jpg" alt="waronsecrecy">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rusbridger said it was "an interesting matter for speculation" whether US media atttitudes would change if Assange was ever to be prosecuted. But it would be difficult to do that "without also putting five editors in the dock" and that would be "the media case of the century".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"It was astonishing to sit in London reading of reasonably mainstream American figures calling for the assassination of Assange for what he had unleashed. It was surprising to see the widespread reluctance among American journalists to support the general ideal and work of WikiLeaks. For some it simply boiled down to a reluctance to admit that Assange was a journalist."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, and even though the Guardian was still publishing dozens of stories about the cables every week, Rusbridger made it clear that he had no further use for Assange:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"While Assange was certainly our main source for the documents, he was in no sense a conventional source – he was not the original source and certainly not a confidential one. Latterly, he was not even the only source&#8230;&#8203; When, to Assange&#8217;s fury, WikiLeaks itself sprang a leak, the irony of the situation was almost comic."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rusbridger might not have thought it was so funny if he knew that his brother-in-law&#8217;s book was also about to cause a far worse leak, with profound repercussions. One of the chapter headings in the book contained the passphrase to unlock the entire Cablegate archive. This was not a conventional password. Assange had personally written it down for Leigh, but even then he took an extra precaution (in cryptographic terms, an additional "salt"):</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange wrote down on a scrap of paper: <code>ACollectionOfHistorySince_1966_ToThe_PresentDay#</code></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That&#8217;s the password," he said. "But you have to add one extra word when you type it in. You have to put in the word 'Diplomatic' before the word 'History'. Can you remember that?"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the book repeatedly shows, Assange was far from impressed by Leigh&#8217;s technological expertise. Leigh could not even open a standard compressed file, and needed help to view the files even after the passphrase had unlocked them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leigh later complained that Assange told him the passphrase was only temporary. Assange vehemently denied this. It was in fact the secure server, which Leigh used to access the archive, that was temporary. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/unredacted-us-embassy-cables-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardian statement</a> later made this clear:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The embassy cables were shared with the Guardian through a secure server for a period of hours, after which the server was taken offline and all files removed, as was previously agreed by both parties."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leigh himself even noted this in his book, as Kristinn Hrafnsson <a href="https://twitter.com/khrafnsson/status/1232404629314572289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a>:</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<img src="2011leighpassword.jpeg" alt="2011leighpassword">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For years to come, however, Guardian journalists would accuse Assange of sloppy security while insisting their colleagues did nothing wrong. Tellingly, Leigh and Harding only published the lengthy passphrase in their book because it was an illuminating example of the extreme lengths Assange took to guarantee security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the time being, at any rate, nobody was going public with concerns about the Cablegate passphrase being published, because the compressed archive files remained secret. But there were plenty of other problems with the new Guardian book.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the book&#8217;s most explosive claims regarded a July 2010 dinner at London&#8217;s Moro restaurant, where journalists working on the Afghan War Diaries had gathered to discuss redactions. According to David Leigh, when discussion turned to protecting the names of the US military&#8217;s Afghan informants, Julian Assange said: “They’re informants, they deserve to die.” Assange vigorously denied ever saying this, but the alleged quote was repeated for years to come as proof of his alleged "disregard for human lives".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That dinner was attended by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Declan Walsh, who <a href="https://insidestory.org.au/wikileaks-deconstructed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Leigh&#8217;s claim. But John Goetz, who also attended the dinner with his Der Spiegel colleague Marcel Rosenbach, <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/Statement_by_John_Goetz.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisted</a> that Julian Assange had never said such a thing. Rosenbach could not remember Assange saying it, but could not be certain he never said it. The only other person at that dinner was Assange himself, who <a href="https://jaraparilla.blogspot.com/2011/09/thoughts-on-assange-and-aspergers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just nonsense: I said some people held that view, but that we would edit the documents to preserve their essential content and not throw harm in people’s way if we could avoid it&#8230;&#8203; In actual fact, we had been burning the midnight oil on redactions from early on.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Who to believe? A clue comes from Australian journalist Mark Davis, who attended many of the Afghan War Diaries meetings as a privileged insider filming the documentary “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSYwncX0J2A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside WikiLeaks</a>”. Davis later <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/08/10/assa-a10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ridiculed</a> Guardian claims that Assange had a "cavalier attitude" to innocent lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"If there was any cavalier attitude, it was the Guardian journalists. They had disdain for the impact of this material.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Davis said the Guardian journalists frequently engaged in "gallows humour" which Assange avoided. And the Guardian wanted to rush publication before redactions were finished, forcing Julian to work all night doing the job himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Julian wanted to take the names out,” Davis said. “He asked for the releases to be delayed.” The request was rejected by the Guardian, “so Julian was left with the task of cleansing the documents. Julian removed 10,000 names by himself, not the Guardian.”</p>

<div class="title">Assange in the Afghan War Logs 'bunker' with the Guardian&#8217;s Nick Davies (right) and David Leigh</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Davis said the Guardian journalists did not care about redactions because they expected WikiLeaks to be blamed, not them or their media partners. He recalled a conversation between Nick Davies and David Leigh, when Assange was not present:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“It occurred to Nick Davies as they pulled up an article they were going to put in the newspaper  —  he said ‘Well, we can’t name this guy'. And then someone said ‘Well he’s going to be named on the website.’ Davies said something to the effect of ‘We’ll really cop it then, if and when we are blamed for putting that name up.’ And the words I remember very precisely  from David Leigh was - he gazed across the room at Davies and said: ‘But we’re not publishing it.’”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mark Davis accused the Guardian and the New York Times of attempted “subterfuge&#8230;&#8203; pushing Julian out to walk the plank”. If WikiLeaks published the cables first, before media partners ran their stories, Assange would be legally to blame for any repurcussions. But their plan failed due to technical issues: when the first Afghan War Log stories were published, WikiLeaks was offline. Neverthess, media partners' stories falsely stated that WikiLeaks had "published" the files, not them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next major bombshell from the Guardian&#8217;s new book was that Julian Assange was an anti-Semite, or at least worked closely with an allegedly "notorious anti-Semite" named Israel Shamir, who just happened to have been born Jewish, lost family members in the Nazi Holocaust, and trained with the Israeli Defence Force. This was the first of many bizarre anti-Assange allegations from new Guardian journalist James Ball, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101025125124/http://www.iraqwarlogs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> the Iraq War Logs stories for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism before <a href="https://wikileaks.org/IMG/html/gibney-transcript.html#3760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very briefly</a> joining WikiLeaks in November 2010.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although Ball <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-us-press-office/james-ball-joins-guardian-us-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> the Guardian in February 2011, the 31 January 2011 Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/31/wikileaks-holocaust-denier-handled-moscow-cables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> promoting the Guardian book refers to him only as an anonymous "insider" who claimed that Israel Shamir had "demanded copies of cables about 'the Jews'".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>James Ball re-hashed this claim under his own name in a November 2011 Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/08/israel-shamir-julian-assange-cult-machismo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> where he stated:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shamir aroused the suspicion of several WikiLeaks staffers – myself included – when he asked for access to all cable material concerning "the Jews", a request which was refused.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shamir <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/Ball.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded</a> that it was Ball himself who had given him these cables.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You did it even twice: just before my departure you came to me on your own initiative and kindly handed me "a better file on Jews", twice as big as the previous one.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>James Ball, who had also previously worked as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120719155933/http://www.jamesrb.co.uk/?page_id=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researcher</a> for Heather Brooke (who gave the Cablegate archive to the New York Times), further stated:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shamir has a years-long friendship with Assange, and was privy to the contents of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables months before WikiLeaks made public the full cache.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shamir&#8217;s "years-long friendship with Assange" turned out to be at best a wild exaggeration. And if Shamir really had such access to the files, why would he have needed to ask anyone for them?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These "anti-Semite" claims, smearing Julian Assange and WikiLeaks by association with Shamir, were <a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/03/01/wikileaks-responds-to-private-eye-story-we-published/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeated</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610032215/https://www.crikey.com.au/2011/03/02/eye-on-the-guardian-and-assange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeated</a> again by Britain&#8217;s Private Eye magazine, with a tired Julian Assange denying that he made anti-Semitic remarks about a "Jewish conspiracy" in frustrated phone calls with editor Ian Hislop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jennifer Lipman from the Jewish Chronicle, who "worked with Julian Assange in the past" and "never heard him express any antisemitic sentiments", <a href="https://www.thejc.com/comment/analysis/julian-assange-you-need-to-explain-1.21612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wanted</a> an explanation. She noted that that Julian Assange had also been called "an agent of Mossad because the WikiLeaks cables did not provide enough evidence of Israeli government wrongdoing". Even the non-profit <a href="https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2011/02/wikileaks-belarus-and-israel-shamir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Index on Censorship</a>, which had awarded Assange their new media prize in 2008, weighed in with questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks was eventually forced to issue a <a href="https://archive.fo/hcjq9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy response</a> which said in part:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Israel Shamir has never worked or volunteered for WikiLeaks, in any manner, whatsoever. He has never written for WikiLeaks or any associated organization, under any name and we have no plan that he do so. He is not an 'agent' of WikiLeaks. He has never been an employee of WikiLeaks and has never received monies from WikiLeaks or given monies to WikiLeaks or any related organization or individual. However, he has worked for the BBC, Haaretz, and many other reputable organizations.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is false that Shamir is 'an Assange intimate'. He interviewed Assange (on behalf of Russian media), as have many journalists. He took a photo at that time and has only met with WikiLeaks staff (including Asssange) twice. It is false that 'he was trusted with selecting the 250,000 US State Department cables for the Russian media' or that he has had access to such at any time.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Note</dt>
<dd>
<p>Shamir&#8217;s son Johannes Wahlström also published Cablegate stories in Sweden. Complaints about WikiLeaks' connection to Shamir were first raised in Swedish media after he published a September 2010 <a href="https://archive.is/bAji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> suggesting the sex allegations against Assange could be a CIA "honeypot". These issues were first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913080943/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-israel-shamir-russia-scandinavia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed</a> by the Guardian in 17 December 2010 blog that falsely called Shamir "WikiLeaks&#8217;s spokesperson and conduit in Russia". James Ball thought it was very odd that Shamir was introducted to WikiLeaks staff as "Adam" but he was widely reported to have used at least six names and the contact email address at the bottom of his September 2010 story was "<a href="mailto:adam@israelshamir.net">adam@israelshamir.net</a>".</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks also noted that Shamir had been obliged, like all media partners, to sign a non-disclosure agreement before getting access to any files. And yet James Ball two months later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/wikileaks-confidentiality-agreement-julian-assange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticised Assange</a> for forcing staff to sign non-disclosure documents. Ball claimed that he "inadvertently" leaked a copy of his own non-disclosure agreement, which he had refused to sign, calling it "by orders of magnitude the most restrictive I have ever encountered". As usual with media critics, Assange was damned if he did and damned if he didn&#8217;t. Without a hint of self-awareness, James Ball concluded that WikiLeaks, the world&#8217;s leading transparency organisation, "needs to get out of the gagging game."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>James Ball further reported that Israel Shamir had given unredacted US cables to the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who then used that information to crack down on dissenters. Again there was no proof for this allegation, just a photo of Shamir outside the steps of the Belarus Presidential Administation Building in Minsk on the day elections were being held, 19 December 2010. Shamir wrote an article explaining why he was in his mother&#8217;s home town of Minsk at the time, but nevertheless Julian Assange was falsely accused for years to come of endangering the lives of Belarussian dissidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When discussion of the cables appeared in Belarus state media, WikiLeaks supporters offered an <a href="https://kittyhundal.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-recent-defamation-of-wikileaks-and.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alternative explanation</a>: Shamir gave the cables to a human rights group called Charter 97, who then published <a href="https://charter97.org/en/news/2010/12/18/34755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">articles</a> criticizing the Lukashenko regime. The Belarus police then brought down their website, raided their offices, arrested them, and thus (possibly) got access to the cables. But it seems the new cables on Belarus were first published by "Russian Reporter", a magazine that was <a href="https://archive.is/NrVnR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condemned</a> by the Russia&#8217;s state-owned Moscow Times, who also called Shamir a "notorious anti-Semite". In any case, nobody was harmed as a direct result of the cables going public, as even US government officials later admitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were massive protests after Lukashenko claimed victory in the elections. Opposition leader Andrei Sannikov was just one of dozens imprisoned. But a year later, Sannikov&#8217;s sister Irina, a spokesperson for the Free Belarus campaign, invited Julian Assange to <a href="https://youtu.be/3JbpqP6eIIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host a Q &amp; A session</a> at the premiere screening of their film, "Europe&#8217;s Last Dictator". It was then more clear than ever that Assange had been helping Belarussian dissidents in the background, not helping get them killed. Nevertheless Britain&#8217;s New Statesman magazine <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2012/03/belarus-assange-lukashenko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complained</a> that "to dignify Assange with a place on the podium at an event about Belarus is to mock the men and women who endure the brutality of Lukashenko". Obviously the author, a "freelancer from India" whose work had appeared in the Boston Globe, the Chicago Tribune, and the Los Angeles Times, knew more about Belarussia than the dissidents who had invited Assange to speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the USA meddles a great deal in former Soviet bloc nations nations like Belarus. According to the New Statesman, Shamir expressed delight when US-backed agents were exposed. But as WikiLeaks <a href="https://archive.fo/hcjq9#selection-555.1-555.297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautioned</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We do not have editorial control over the hundreds of journalists and publications based on our materials and it would be wrong for us to seek to do so. We do not approve or endorse the writings of the world&#8217;s media. We disagree with many of the approaches taken in analyzing our material.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, the great benefit of WikiLeaks releases is that readers can view the source material for themselves and draw their own conclusions. It is also worth noting that UK public support would be critical to Julian Assange in the years ahead, and the people most likely to support WikiLeaks in 2011 were anti-war, anti-Establishment, left wing types. But the UK&#8217;s most "left wing" UK publications - the Guardian, New Statesman and Private Eye - were all quickly lining up to criticize the WikiLeaks founder. Right wing media organisations like the Telegraph or the Times gave Assange and WikiLeaks far less column space (almost all negative). By design or accident, the local audience most likely to support Assange was being actively discouraged from doing so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this confected "anti-Semitism" debate raged, Stephen Spielberg&#8217;s DreamWorks studio had quietly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917044711/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/02/spielberg-assange-wikileaks-guardian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought the rights</a> to both the Guardian&#8217;s "WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange&#8217;s War on Secrecy" and Domscheit-Berg&#8217;s poor-selling book (now with an English version, still low sales). The <a href="https://wikileaks.org/IMG/html/gibney-transcript.html#3760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">untrustworthy</a> movie that eventually resulted would predictably become a miserable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328121514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wikileaks-sabotages-fifth-estate-own-649685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flop</a> ("the worst opening of the year so far for a movie opening in more than 1,500 theaters"). But Alan Rusbridger was gushing with excitement:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>

<p>"It&#8217;s Woodward and Bernstein meets Stieg Larsson meets Jason Bourne. Plus the odd moment of sheer farce and, in Julian Assange, a compelling character who goes beyond what any Hollywood scriptwriter would dare to invent."</p>

<p>And David Leigh, who had recklessly published the Cablegate passphrase, was recklessly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610032135/https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/12/the-guardians-david-leigh-talks-about-julian-assange-and-wikileaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throwing around</a> accusations of recklessness. He said Assange was a "reckless amateur" journalist who was "being reckless and opportunistic" by "palling up with" Russia and "giving material to very unsuitable people. He complained that WikiLeaks staff "like to see themselves as having some God-like virtue which enables them to behave in some pretty reckless and unethical ways."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leigh&#8217;s co-author Luke Harding, who won Private Eye&#8217;s 2007 <a href="https://archive.ph/UUCBD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plagiarist of the Year</a> award, was denied entry back into Moscow after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819135335/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables-russia-mafia-kleptocracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publishing</a> numerous stories about US cables critical of Russia.

<p>After toppling leaders in Tunisia and Egypt, the Arab Spring protests spread into Algeria, Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, Syria, Kuwait, Morrocco, Oman, Sudan and even Saudi Arabia. By March 2011 the world&#8217;s focus was on oil-rich Libya, where eccentric leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi had been in power since 1969. In February alone WikiLeaks posted some 17 <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2079" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweets</a> mentioning Libya and released hundreds of US diplomatic cables about the North African nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the leaked cables <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13302639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Gaddafi, who claimed to be a pious Muslim, "relies heavily" on a "voluptuous blonde" Ukranian nurse, who later sought asylum in Norway.</p>

<p>Gaddafi claimed that Libyan protesters were "drugged" and/or linked to al-Qaeda, swearing that he would die a martyr rather than leave Libya. After the Libyan army opened fire on protesters in the rebellious city of Benghazi, many senior officials resigned or joined rebel groups, prompting a six months-long civil war.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NATO forces imposed a no-fly zone over the country in March, following a UN Resolution in February. US President Obama claimed the USA was only <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/1575">reluctantly</a> getting involved:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leaked emails from Hillary Clinton, published by WikiLeaks in 2016, later showed the US Secretary of State was the principal architect of the US-lead invasion. Assange <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/386982-assange-clinton-butcher-libya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">branded</a> her "the butcher of Libya" and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04MDYW1oEe0&amp;ab_channel=Ruptly">claimed</a> she used the invasion as a basis for her failed 2016 Presidential campaign. Over 1,700 of Clinton&#8217;s leaked emails mentioned Libya.</p>
