<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 9 June 2013 the face of Edward Snowden appeared on TV screens and newspapers around the world. His 12 minute <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Guardian journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, filmed by Laura Poitras, had been recorded over several days in a Hong Kong hotel room. He spoke carefully, but with evident confidence and conviction.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Uh, my name is Ed Snowden. I&#8217;m, uh, 29 years old. I work for Booz Allen Hamilton as an Infrastructure Analyst for NSA, uh, in Hawaii."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous four days, Greenwald, MacAskill and the Washington Post&#8217;s Barton Gellman had shocked the world with explosive revelations about the US intelligence community&#8217;s extraordinary powers of surveillance. Systems already exposed included PRISM, which gave the NSA direct access to data held by Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, plus the Boundless Informant program, a big data analysis and visualization tool which let the NSA record and analyse where information was coming from. President Obama had quickly defended the intrusive NSA programs, claiming "the right balance" had been struck between security and privacy. He said US citizens had to make a choice:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You can&#8217;t have 100% security, and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now Snowden was coming forward as the source of these stories, explaining that his conscience would not let him continue working for the NSA while their powers grew exponentially year by year, without any public scrutiny. Like Chelsea Manning, he said his aim was to reveal the truth and trigger a public debate about "the world we want to live in".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector, anywhere," he explained. "Not all analysts have the ability to target everything. But I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President, if I had a personal email."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Snowden said he was prepared for whatever might happen to him, noting that the CIA had "an office just up the road here in Hong Kong", but "I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong". He said he was revealing himself so that the media&#8217;s attention would be on the documents he revealed, rather than the search for an unknown whistle-blower. But of course the world&#8217;s media - not to mention intelligence agents - were now desperate to get hold of him ASAP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, Snowden said goodbye to Poitras and the Guardian journalists, knowing that any further contact with them could reveal his location and jeapordize his life.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“I was being tailed,” Poitras told <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sarah-harrison-edward-snowden-wikileaks-nsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vogue magazine</a>. “The risks became very great.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Snowden checked out of his hotel and moved into Hong Kong&#8217;s crowded tenements, where - with a little help from a Canadian human rights lawyer - he was sheltered by a group of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/28/snowden-refugees-canada-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asylum seekers</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Hong Kong government quickly made it clear they did not want to damage relations with the USA by allowing Snowden to stay. This is where WikiLeaks stepped in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sarah Harrison was "on WikiLeaks business" in Melbourne, Australia - presumably helping with the WikiLeaks Party - when Julian Assange asked her to urgently fly to Hong Kong, a city she knew well because her two sisters <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2351726/Were-proud-Wikileaks-daughter-say-family-British-blonde-went-run-CIA-whistleblower.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lived</a> there. Harrison quickly packed her bags, leaving half her luggage behind as she expected to return soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the next thirteen days, Harrison and Assange tried to obtain diplomatic protection for Snowden, meeting with lawyers in Hong Kong and working trusted connections within the Ecuadorian government. WikiLeaks booked more than a dozen different flights for Harrison and Snowden.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“We also got Snowden to buy a ticket to India on his own credit card,” Harrison says. “We were working very hard to lay as many false trails as possible. I just kept hoping the tickets would be OK’d”.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Harrison didn’t actually meet Snowden until the morning of Sunday 24 June, when he climbed into a car with her and headed to the airport. They both dressed casually, hoping to look like a young couple on vacation, and barely spoke until their Aeroflot flight to Moscow was in the air. Then Snowden turned to Harrison and joked:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“I didn’t expect that WikiLeaks was going to send a ninja to get me out.”</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The government of Hong Kong confirmed that Snowden had left the country of his own accord. By then the USA had hurriedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/us-charging-edward-snowden-with-espionage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed multiple charges</a> against Snowden and were demanding his immediate arrest. Hong Kong officials said the US documents seeking his detention did not "fully comply" with their legal requirements (they later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/26/edward-snowden-name-wrong-hong-kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that US officials got Snowden&#8217;s middle name wrong, writing "James" instead of "Joseph"). They angrily demanded that US officials clarify Snowden&#8217;s recent <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1266777/exclusive-snowden-safe-hong-kong-more-us-cyberspying-details-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> that the NSA was spying on Hong Kong and mainland China.</p>

<div class="title">Hong Kong media reporting Snowden&#8217;s departure.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WikiLeaks "ninja" still had a lot of work to do. Arriving safely in transit at Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo airport on 23 June 2013, Snowden and Harrison tried to check-in for their onward flight to Latin America, only to discover that Snowden&#8217;s passport had been cancelled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now journalists were swarming all over the airport. Media were reporting that Snowden would be flying to Havana, Cuba. At least one journalist booked a seat on Snowden&#8217;s expected flight, only to find it empty. Snowden - and Harrison - had disappeared.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, both US President Obama and US Secretary of State John Kerry urged Russia to hand over the "fugitive from justice". But Russia&#8217;s foreign minister insisted that Snowden had never even crossed the border into Russia. This was technically true: Harrison and Snowden, who did not have a Russian visa, were trapped in the airport&#8217;s "In Transit" zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin eventually admitted that Snowden was at Sheremetyevo airport but he said the NSA whistle-blower was free to leave Russia at any time and would not be extradited to the USA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obama immediately toned down his rhetoric, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFyDYh9a5o&amp;ab_channel=AssociatedPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling</a> a press conference in Senegal that he didn&#8217;t want to be “wheeling and dealing and trading” just to “get a guy extradited.”</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I&#8217;m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker," the US President said.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Snowden, of course, was not a criminal hacker, and he had celebrated his 30th birthday just before leaving Hong Kong. In a <a href="https://wlcentral.org/node/2827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> marking his first year in the embassy, Julian Assange said President Obama was far more deserving of the label "traitor" than Snowden ever would be:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Who was it who promised a generation "hope" and "change", only to betray those promises with dismal misery and stagnation? Who took an oath to defend the US constitution, only to feed the invisible beast of secret law devouring it alive from the inside out?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Who is it that promised to preside over The Most Transparent Administration in history, only to crush whistleblower after whistleblower with the boot heel of espionage charges?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Who combined in his executive the powers of judge, jury and executioner, and claimed the jurisdiction of the entire earth on which to exercise those powers? Who arrogates the power to spy on the entire earth - every single one of us - and when he is caught red handed, explains to us that "we&#8217;re going to have to make a choice".</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Assange praised Snowden&#8217;s courage, saying "the mark of international distinction and service to humanity is no longer the Nobel Peace Prize, but an espionage indictment from the US Department of Justice".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile the USA was putting immense pressure on countries around the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ecuador initially appeared ready to give Snowden asylum, especially after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141122023552/http://wikileaks.org/IMG/html/Affidavit_of_Julian_Assange.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovering</a> a bugging device in their London embassy. But President Correa back-tracked after Spanish media <a href="http://noticias.univision.com/america-latina/ecuador/article/2013-06-27/quien-escribio-salvoconducto-snowden#axzz2XVzze57e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> documents including a safe conduct pass for Snowden, dated 22 June 2013, which bore the name (but not the signature) of Ecuador&#8217;s London consul, Fidel Narvaez, who was a strong supporter of Assange. Ecuador&#8217;s ambassador to the USA told a colleague that someone should talk to Assange, because "from outside, he appears to be running the show." This was embarrassing for President Correa, who had already cancelled a key US trade pact and slyly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/ecuador-us-trade-pact-edward-snowden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered</a> the USA a $23m donation for human rights training.</p>

<p>Correa said US Vice President Joe Biden had personally and very politely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/29/edward-snowden-biden-correa-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> him not to give asylum to Snowden, but Ecuador would not make such a decision unless Snowden turned up on their soil:</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.

<p>A day earlier, Sarah Harrison had personally <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Edward-Snowden-submits-asylum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> a number of requests for asylum to an official at the Russian consulate in Sheremetyevo Airport. The countries petitioned included Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Finland, France, Germany India, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and Venezuela. Previous requests had been submitted to Ecuador and Iceland (where the CEO of DataCell had <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/06/21/snowden_private_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered</a> to fly Snowden in a private jet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vladimir Putin immediately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/01/putin-snowden-remain-russia-offer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a> Snowden&#8217;s appeal:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Considering that he considers himself a human rights activist and a fighter for human rights, he probably doesn&#8217;t plan to stop this work, so he should choose a host country and head there. When this will happen I, unfortunately, do not know."</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These harsh comments, which lead to Snowden withrawing his Russian asylum application a day later, came despite many Russian MPs calling for Snowden to stay, with some even offering to nominate him for a Nobel peace prize. Putin, a former KGB intelligence officer, also denied that Snowden was a Russian spy, as many critics in the US media were claiming.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>Snowden later claimed that he had been approached by Russian agents in the airport but turned them away. Sarah Harrison <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/09/12/edward_snowden_wikileaks_sarah_harrison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that it wasn&#8217;t possible to broker a deal on asylum because Snowden had already handed over all his files to Western journalists.</p>

<p>In early July 2013, Moscow hosted a major <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/18429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summit</a> of gas exporting countries, with numerous world leaders in attendance. On the last day of the summit, Bolivian president Evo Morales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/edward-snowden-bolivia-lifeline-asylum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> his country was keen to "shield the denounced" and would likely consider Snowden&#8217;s asylum request favourably.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, after flying uninterrupted over Poland and the Czech Republic on the way home to Bolivia, the Presidential airplane of Evo Morales was forced to land unexpectedly in Vienna, the Austrian capital.

<p>Two years later, Julian Assange <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/28/assange_on_the_untold_story_of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that WikiLeaks had inadvertently played a part in the grounding of Morales' plane. He said WikiLeaks staff, while trying to help Snowden get out of Moscow, had "managed to get some intelligence on the US government thinking of the different types of jets and that they were concerned that the presidential jets might be difficult for them, from a legal perspective".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said this caused the WikiLeaks team to start thinking about getting Snowden out of Moscow on one of the Presidential jets that were in town for the oil summit.

<p>Meanwhile, week after week of major media revelations from Snowden&#8217;s files were changing how the world understood government surveillance. Journalists used to ridicule Julian Assange&#8217;s protective security measures - like putting a cover over a laptop camera - as "paranoid". But now they learned that Edward Snowden, an experienced NSA professional, had lined the door of his Hong Kong hotel room with pillows and put a large red hood over his head and laptop when entering passwords. It is beyond the scope of this book to examine all Snowden&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revelations</a>, but the whole world was suddenly looking at their emails, phones, laptops - and the US intelligence agencies - in a whole new light.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>World leaders were not the only ones coming under pressure from Washington. On 5 July the editors of the Washington Post - whose own journalist Bart Gellman had published front page scoops based on the files given to him by Laura Poitras - wrote a bizarre <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-keep-edward-snowden-from-leaking-more-nsa-secrets/2013/07/01/4e8bbe28-e278-11e2-a11e-c2ea876a8f30_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial</a> titled "Plugging the leaks in the Edward Snowden case". After helping expose PRISM and other intrusive NSA surveillance programs, the paper now said it was necessary to prevent Snowden "from leaking information that harms efforts to fight terrorism and conduct legitimate intelligence operations."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In London, the Guardian had published scoops revealing that GCHQ (Britain&#8217;s Government Communications Headquarters) also had access to PRISM, had intercepted foreign politicians' communications at the 2009 G20 summit, could tap into to the global network of Internet cables, and was sharing information with the NSA. On 20 July, GCHQ officers forced Guardian editors with angle grinders and electric drills to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destroy</a> the hard drives that had contained the Snowden files. This followed a threat of legal action by the British government, which could have stopped the UK Guardian publishing further Snowden revelations. Bizarrely, the Guardian&#8217;s US office - and others - still had copies of the files. Two weeks later the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that GCHQ had received at least £100m from the US government in exchange for access to and influence over Britain&#8217;s intelligence gathering programmes.</p>

<p>Journalists at Moscow airport had by now spent weeks desperately hoping for a glimpse of Snowden.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“I’ve spent up to eighteen hours a day beyond passport control and security looking for Snowden,” complained one ABC News employee after just a week. “There is an irrational fear, even late at night, that the moment I call it quits he’ll come strolling down the hall.”</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sarah Harrison later <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/09/12/edward_snowden_wikileaks_sarah_harrison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> how she and Snowden had managed to hide from the media for 39 days. She said the Moscow airport officials were "very kind", partly because this was "the most exciting thing that had happened to them in a long time."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The transit area is enclosed but they were able to find us a room, not the most pleasant of rooms - it didn&#8217;t have a window or anything - but it did allow us to shut the door and stay in there with very little outgoings."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They did their laundry in a small sink, watched movies on their laptops, and survived on airport food. Harrison managed to occasionally move around the airport with some simple disguises - "For girls, it’s a bit easier to fit in”" - but mostly stayed with Snowden to provide a form of 24/7 protection, knowing WikiLeaks could reach a huge global audience very quickly if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>“If anything untoward happened to him, I was there as a witness. We would have made sure that the world knew.”</p>

<p>Assange <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/28/assange_on_the_untold_story_of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he had advised Edward Snowden that he would be safest in Russia, but Snowden "didn’t want to be accused of being some kind of Russian spy&#8230;&#8203; he didn’t want that kind of propaganda attack to distract from the revelations, even though it would place him at some increased risk".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the downing of the Bolivian President&#8217;s plane, however, and even though a handful of angry Latin American governments had stepped forward to offer asylum, "at a legal level, in terms of asylum law, it was very clear that there could not be a fair process". Any attempt by Snowden to leave Russia now would put his life at risk.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="title">Sarah Harrison and Edward Snowden leaving Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo airport</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 1 August 2013, with help from a prominent Russian lawyer, Edward Snowden and Sarah Harrison finally left the transit zone of Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo airport and officially entered Russia. WikiLeaks issued a <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/Statement-on-Snowden-s-Successful.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> explaining that Snowden&#8217;s certificate of temporary asylum afforded him "the right to live in and travel around Russia, where he can now plan his next steps in safety".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks noted that President Barack Obama "while elected on a platform promising to protect whistleblowers, has now prosecuted more national security whistleblowers than all other presidents in United States history combined". They also noted US efforts to block asylum were a violation of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2312 (1967), which states:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"the grant of asylum. . . is a peaceful and humanitarian act and&#8230;&#8203; as such, it cannot be regarded as unfriendly by any other State."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, of all the countries in the world, it was only Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua who "stood strong and granted Mr Snowden asylum".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a meeting with lawyers and human rights organisations on the 12th July, Mr Snowden announced that he accepted Venezuela&#8217;s asylum offer, although ultimately US interference has, at least for the time being, prevented its practical acceptance.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Harrison and Snowden left the airport in a taxi and headed to a "secure, confidential place." Sarah Harrison stayed with Ed Snowden for another three months before flying to Berlin at the end of 2013. She <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Statement-by-Sarah-Harrison.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> her lawyers had advised her not to return home to Britain, where she could be detained under sweeping new antiterrorism laws. Edward Snowden praised the woman who had helped save him from life in a US supermax prison - or worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Sarah refuses to allow intimidation to shape her decisions," he said. "If you forced her to choose between disowning her principles or being burned at the stake, I think she’d hand you a match’."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In early August 2013, in response to mounting public anger, President Obama announced changes to US surveillance programs, which he claimed to have been planning for a long time. He insisted that Edward Snowden did not deserve any credit:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. As I said in my opening remarks, I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks. My preference – and I think the American people’s preference – would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful, fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place, because I never made claims that all the surveillance technologies … somehow didn’t require, potentially, some additional reforms. That’s exactly what I called for."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In response, Bart Gellman <a href="https://tcf.org/content/commentary/meet-the-press-bart-gellman-on-snowdens-incredible-success/?session=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Snowden “has accomplished far more than anyone in his position could have reasonably hoped to have accomplished.”</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“He told me that his greatest fear was that he would come out and do this and the whole story would be&#8230;&#8203; roiling around for a day and it would be gone,” Gellman said. “But it’s at the top of the agenda now for two months.”</p>

<p>A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140102151514/http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2013/06/michael_hastings_cia_coverage_crash_fire.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the Los Angeles Weekly that Hastings had been scared to get into his own car just hours before he died, and had begged her to let him borrow her Volvo. She turned him down, saying her car had mechanical problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online forums began speculating that the US intelligence services may have murdered Hastings by hacking into his car&#8217;s onboard computer and forcing it to drive at full throttle till he crashed. In 2017 the WikiLeaks Vault7 release <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2017/03/wikileaks-vault-7-remote-car-hack-assassination-michael-hastings-conspiracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that such dangerous CIA software tools did indeed exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, Michael Hastings' family were quick to hose down such "conspiracy theories". They revealed that Hastings had suffered a "manic episode" fifteen years earlier, where drugs and alcohol were involved, and they believed he was experiencing a similar episode when he died. In a Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/11/05/michael_hastings_life_and_death_a_brothers_reflections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> on 5 November 2013, Hastings' elder brother Jonathan explained that he had flown down from New York a day before Michael died, hoping to get him into a rehab clinic.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I’d thought that I had at least convinced Mike to just stay in his apartment and chill out for the next few days, but he snuck out on me when I was sleeping. He crashed his car before anyone could do anything to help him."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jonathan Hastings said his family had "no real complaints" about the LA police or the <a href="https://app.box.com/s/qyq9xnffpax0glb6pk5s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coroner’s report</a>, which "didn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know or strongly suspect." The report said Michael Hastings had been been proscribed "medical marijuana" to help deal with PTSD since his war reporting years; after using marijuana the night before he died, he had "passed out" around 1 am, at which stage his brother had gone to stay with a neighbour. The report said Michael Hastings was also "believed" to be using the hallucinogenic drug DMT:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Toxicology shows a small amount of amphetamine in the blood, consistent with possible intake of methamphetamine many hours before death, unlikely to have produced an intoxicative effect at the time of the accident. Marijuana was present in the blood, but mostly in the form of its metabolite, indicating intake hours earlier. All other drugs were negative".</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, Jonathan Hastings said he ruled out foul play "entirely".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I might have been suspicious if I hadn’t been with him the day before he died. After all, he definitely was investigating and writing about a lot of sensitive subjects. But based on being with him and talking to people who were worried about him in the weeks leading up to his death, and being around him when he had had similar problems when he was younger, I was pretty much convinced that he wasn’t in danger from any outside agency."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TPP</a>) was a proposed global trade agreement that enshrined many deeply unpopular aspects of globalisation, including threats to environmental regulations, developing countries, and internet freedom. The TPP was a major part of a huge raft of global trade deals including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trade in Service Agreement (TiSA).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In late 2012, when massive global protests appeared incapable of stopping the secretive deals, Just Foreign Policy <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2012/08/17/lets-help-wikileaks-liberate-trans-pacific-partnership-negotiating-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> a novel approach:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just Foreign Policy said it was a great way for people to show support for WikiLeaks while also expressing public opposition to the TPP.

<p>WikiLeaks never managed to publish the full contents of the TPP, but on 13 November 2013 - just days before a decisive TPP Chief Negotiators Summit in Salt Lake City -  WikiLeaks <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/tpp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the current draft text of the highly controversial Intellectual Property Rights Chapter, which had critical implications for global Internet freedom. The draft chapter <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/tpp/pressrelease.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> that Australia and the USA were isolated in negotiations:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Australia, an important US ally, lined up with the US 64 times, considerably more than the next highest, Peru (54), Singapore (51).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Throughout the text it is clear that on the contentious issues, Australia&#8217;s position is closely aligned with the US. Australia and the US are the only two countries to object to a proposal to limit Internet service providers' liability in relation to copyright infringement, a proposal supported by the remaining countries (minus Japan which does not express its position)."</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"From locking in excessive copyright term limits to further entrenching failed policies that give legal teeth to Digital Rights Management (DRM) tools, the TPP text we’ve seen today reflects a terrible but unsurprising truth: an agreement negotiated in near-total secrecy, including corporations but excluding the public, comes out as an anti-user wish list of industry-friendly policies."</p>

<p>On 15 January 2014, WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-enviro/pressrelease.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the secret draft text of the TPP&#8217;s Environment Chapter and the corresponding Chairs' Report. Julian Assange said the environmental chapter was clearly just "a toothless public relations exercise with no enforcement mechanism."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"When compared against other TPP chapters, the Environment Chapter is noteworthy for its absence of mandated clauses or meaningful enforcement measures. The dispute settlement mechanisms it creates are cooperative instead of binding; there are no required penalties and no proposed criminal sanctions. With the exception of fisheries, trade in 'environmental' goods and the disputed inclusion of other multilateral agreements, the Chapter appears to function as a public relations exercise."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 16 October 2014, just days before "decisive" TPP meetings in Canberra and Sydney, WikiLeaks <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/tpp-ip2/pressrelease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an updated version of the TPP Intellectual Property Rights chapter. The update showed little change to controversial and damaging areas like digital rights, but also "significant industry-favouring additions within the areas of pharmaceuticals and patents". Bracketed sections showed there was still huge internal disagreement and negotiations on key areas appeared to have stalled. Julian Assange said the TPP was clearly "too damaging to be brought into force" and "should stop now".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further public protests were again brushed away as negotiations continued until early 2016, when the TPP trade agreement was formally signed by leaders from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States. Months later, however, newly elected US president Donald Trump withdrew the USA from the deal, fulfilling an election promise. This meant the TPP could not be ratified and did not enter into force. The remaining countries signed a new trade agreement, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, on 30 December 2018.</p>

<p>Days later, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee, where he was forced to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/guardian-editor-alan-rusbridger-home-affairs-committee-nsa-live-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defend</a> the publishing of Snowden stories, which MPs labelled “woefully irresponsible”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rusbridger said that in every case bar one he had consulted the DA Notice pre-publication censorship committee before publishing. He was accused of "putting lives at risk" by sending unredacted Snowden documents overseas to the New York Times, but Rusbridger said he had told the UK Cabinet Secretary he was doing this in July and the government had not complained. Cressida Dick, the Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said the the alleged communication of agents’ names abroad was a potential breach of section 58(a) of the Terrorism Act.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In August 2013, David Miranda, the partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, had been <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/08/david-miranda-gleen-greenwald-s-partner-detained-for-nine-hours-at-heathrow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detained</a> for nine hours at London&#8217;s Heathrow Airport and questioned under anti-terrorism laws. Miranda was en route from Berlin to his home in Rio De Janeiro, carrying encrypted material from the Snowden files, which was seized. Greenwald had angrily <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/317653-greenwald-blasts-failed-attempt-at-intimidation-after-partner-is-detained?rl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded</a> that he would "write much more aggressively than before.” He resigned from the Guardian two months later to help set up a new, supposedly more aggressive, news organisation called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intercept" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Intercept</a>". Now Cressida Dick told the Commons comitte that police still had not been able to decrypt the files taken from Miranda, but the investigation might yet result in charges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Labour MP Keith Vaz, who was born in Yemen, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/guardian-editor-alan-rusbridger-home-affairs-committee-nsa-live-coverage?view=desktop#block-529e0e21e4b0acc591790acf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> Rusbridger: "Do you love this country?" Somewhat taken aback, the Guardian EIC insisted that he and his staff were "patriots".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asked by Conservative MP Michael Ellis whether he had broken the Terrorism Act, Rusbridger replied that he was not a lawyer so could not answer the question. He said the paper had "made very selective judgments"' about what to publish:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we&#8217;ve seen&#8230;&#8203; There is stuff in there about Iraq and Afghanistan – we&#8217;re not even going to look at it".</p>
