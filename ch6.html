<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the months following Chelsea Manning&#8217;s May 2010 arrest, the US government empaneled a secret grand jury to investigate WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. By the end of the year, the grand jury had produced a secret <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1153486/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sealed indictment</a> charging Julian Assange with conspiracy to hack into a classified US government network.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">NOTE</dt>
<dd>
<p>When an indictment is sealed, all associated information is made secret. Once a defendant is arrested, the sealed indictment then becomes publicly unsealed at arraignment. So the defendant has no idea about the waiting allegations until after they are arrested and most likely jailed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While US grand juries are re-empaneled every few years, with indictiments regularly refreshed, the original year of this indictment&#8217;s creation can be proven by the codes used to identify it. Assange lawyer Michael Ratner later <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Background-for-UN-Talk-Ongoing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> the meaning of a code ("11-3/ 10GJ3793/ 11-937") marked on a <a href="https://couragefound.org/legal_docs/subpoena-11-3-10gj3793-11-1233-letter-re-11-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoena</a> related to the investigation:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The existence of this sealed indictment was routinely denied until Julian Assange was arrested by London police in April 2019, and the original US "computer intrusion" charge, which carried a maximum five years jail, was publicly revealed. A month later, the US government would announce seventeen additional charges, all related to Assange&#8217;s involvement with Chelsea Manning, amounting to a maximum 175 years jail.</p>

<h3 id="_afghan_war_logs">Afghan War Logs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last day of June 2010 was the first day of a momentous three day gathering at the Guardian offices in London. WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange was meeting up with five journalists - John Goetz from Germany&#8217;s Der Spiegel, Eric Schmitt from the New York Times, and the Guardian&#8217;s David Leigh, Nick Davies and Rob Evans - to examine the leaked material that would later be known as the <a href="https://wardiaries.wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghan War Logs</a> (originally the "Afghan War Diary"). Their meeting room soon became the highly secretive new project&#8217;s "bunker".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tareqhaddad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020.09.16-Assange-Extradition-Hearings-Statement-of-John-Goetz.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Goetz</a>, they also wanted to "come up with a plan on how to coordinate journalistic cooperation between the partners."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange was concerned by how much high-level pressure WikiLeaks had received after the publishing of "Collateral Murder". He felt that it would be safer to partner with established media organisations in order to release the rest of the Manning leaks, but he only wanted to work with journalists he could trust. There was a clear benefit to the media organisations involved: exclusive access to a treasure trove of leaks, with journalists from various regions publishing explosive stories related to their own countries. In return, WikiLeaks expected these journalists to help sift through the mountains of data, and publish their articles responsibly. As John Goetz said:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I discussed in detail with Assange in London how documents might be vetted to prevent risk of harm to anyone. He was in agreement as to the importance of protecting confidential sources including certain US and ISAF [International Security Assistance Force, the NATO-led military mission in Afghanistan] sources."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Goetz said this careful approach to redaction was "understood and agreed by all the media partners" and efforts to keep the data secure were "more extreme&#8230;&#8203; than I had ever previously observed as a journalist". He said someone from the Guardian put the complex US military database content into a Microsoft Excel format, making it easier to read, but the work was still "extraordinarily demanding".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The scope was overwhelming and demands upon all involved were enormous and stressful for a range of reasons."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior to the release, Eric Schmitt of the New York Times contacted the White House for comment. He later emailed Goetz to say the Obama administration had requested that WikiLeaks and their partners redact the names of informants and withhold 15,000 documents from publication. WikiLeaks subsequently noted on their <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release page</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We have delayed the release of some 15,000 reports from the total archive as part of a harm minimization process demanded by our source. After further review, these reports will be released, with occasional redactions, and eventually in full, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits. "</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plan was for all the media partners to publish at the same time (so that the US government could not signal out one organisation to blame) with stories linking back to the verifiable data on the WikiLeaks website. But Goetz said Der Spiegel and the Guardian ended up publishing before WikiLeaks:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The Guardian published a couple of hundred documents on their site before WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has some technical delay and their Afghan War Diary website did not go live for a couple of hours after we did."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 25 July 2010, WikiLeaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the Afghan War Diary: 75,000 documents (of the original 91,000) covering a period between January 2004 and December 2009.  Julian Assange <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100727234634/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C708518%2C00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called it</a> "the most comprehensive history of a war ever to be published, during the course of the war - in other words, at a time when they still have a chance of doing some good." He said the leaked documents would "change our perspective on not only the war in Afghanistan, but on all modern wars."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Guardian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110728043710/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-guardian-editorial?intcmp=239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial</a> called the leaks an "unvarnished picture" of a nine year old war that "cannot be won like this":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We today learn of nearly 150 incidents in which coalition forces, including British troops, have killed or injured civilians, most of which have never been reported; of hundreds of border clashes between Afghan and Pakistani troops, two armies which are supposed to be allies; of the existence of a special forces unit whose tasks include killing Taliban and al-Qaida leaders; of the slaughter of civilians caught by the Taliban&#8217;s improvised explosive devices; and of a catalogue of incidents where coalition troops have fired on and killed each other or fellow Afghans under arms."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaks also revealed incidents of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/08/wikileaks-reveals-that-mi_n_793816.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">child prostitution</a> by US Defence contractors, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100730083935/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100727/wl_ynews/ynews_wl3247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychological warfare</a> waged via Afghan media outlets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the months ahead of this release, President Obama had ordered a contoversial "surge" of new US forces in Afghanistan. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-military-leaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed</a> his predecessor, President Bush, for the chaos the leaks revealed:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a statement, the White House said the chaotic picture painted by the logs was the result of "under-resourcing" under Obama&#8217;s predecessor, saying: "It is important to note that the time period reflected in the documents is January 2004 to December 2009."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The White House also claimed that WikiLeaks had "made no effort to contact the US government about these documents." This simply was not true: the media partners had <a href="https://www.tareqhaddad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020.09.16-Assange-Extradition-Hearings-Statement-of-John-Goetz.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> that the New York Times should handle discussions with the US government "because if all the partners contacted the White House independently, there would be chaos".</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="2010augtricktweet.png" alt="2010augtricktweet">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The US government further claimed that the disclosure of this classified information "puts the lives of the US and partner service members at risk and threatens our national security". This claim would be repeated endlessly for years to come, but no solid proof of harm was ever supplied. When US prosecutors ended up in court years later, they could not point to a single incident where anyone had been harmed as a result of WikiLeaks publications. They noted that the Taliban had responded to the release of the Afghan War Logs by publicly stating that they were reviewing the leaks to identify spies whom they could “punish". Assange dryly responded that this that was entirely expected, and that is why names had been redacted. A Senate Committee on Armed Services reported in August 2010 that “the review to date has not revealed any sensitive sources and methods compromised by disclosure”.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<img src="2010aug4tweetwh.png" alt="2010aug4tweetwh">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within days of the Afghan War Logs release, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates <a href="https://archive.is/E1TVI#selection-415.17-415.135" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phoned</a> FBI Director Robert Mueller and asked the FBI to assist in their investigation of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. WikiLeaks said the US Department of State&#8217;s Diplomatic Security Service was also involved in the investigation.</p>
</div>

<p>On the following day, WikiLeaks added an AES-encrypted "insurance file" to the Afghan War Diary page. The 1.4 GigaByte file, with a timestamp of 31 December 2010, was twenty times larger than the just-released Afghan War documents. Cryptographers said it would be virtually impossible to crack unless WikiLeaks revealed the password. Within weeks, the file had been downloaded over 100,000 times, and WikiLeaks was boasting over 100,000 followers on Twitter alone.</p>

<p>Instead of Julian Assange, the federal agents in New York got to hear 27-year-old Jacob Appelbaum, a US citizen and close confidant of Assange, who later said he had been "working with WikiLeaks for about three months". Appelbaum&#8217;s speech was a perfect example of his scathing humour and passionate concern:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Hello to all my friends and fans in domestic and international surveillance,” Appelbaum began. “I am here today because I believe we can make a better world. Julian, unfortunately, can’t make it, because we don’t live in that better world right now, because we haven’t yet made it. I wanted to make a little declaration for the federal agents that are standing in the back of the room and the ones that are standing in the front of the room, and to be very clear about this: I have, on me, in my pocket, some money, the Bill of Rights and a driver’s license, and that’s it. I have no computer system, I have no telephone, I have no keys, no access to anything. There’s absolutely no reason that you should arrest me or bother me. And just in case you were wondering, I’m an American, born and raised, who’s unhappy. I’m unhappy with how things are going.” He paused, interrupted by raucous applause. “To quote from Tron,” he added, “‘I fight for the user.'”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the speech, Appelbaum slipped out a backstage door, using a decoy to distract the federal agents, and went straight to the airport, where he boarded a flight to Berlin two hours later. When he returned to the USA on 29 July 2010, Appelbaum was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/the-american-wikileaks-hacker-238019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detained</a> by US customs officers at Newark Liberty airport. Officials photocopied his receipts, confiscated his phones and laptop, then interrogated him for three hours. Pressed for information on Assange and WikiLeaks, or his opinions on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Appelbaum refused to talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, Julian Assange had made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810002241/http://blog.ted.com/2010/07/26/surprise_speake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise appearance</a> on stage at a TED Talk in Oxford, where he received a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_assange_why_the_world_needs_wikileaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standing ovation</a>.

<p>Even prior to the Afghan War Logs release, WikiLeaks was still busy fending off mounting public criticism. The Wau Holland Foundation in Germany was forced to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810063000/http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarify</a> how they handled donations to Wikileaks. And Assange, who had just been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/16/julian-assange-mediaguardian-100-2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the 58th Most Powerful Person in Global Media, continued demanding more from his media colleagues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Journalism should be more like science," he told one Guardian interviewer (who then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/14/julian-assange-whistleblower-wikileaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> Assange as "a bit odd&#8230;&#8203; cadaverous&#8230;&#8203; like Andy Warhol").</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As far as possible, facts should be verifiable," said Assange. "If journalists want long-term credibility for their profession, they have to go in that direction. Have more respect for readers."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange complained that journalists all too frequently burned their sources without taking any personal risks. Rather provocatively, he compare the death rate of Western journalists with media casualties in more authoritarian regimes:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I think it&#8217;s an international disgrace that so few western journalists have been killed in the course of duty, or have been arrested in the course of duty.

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, Assange rushed to support responsible and courageous journalism. When a Professor of Law at Kings College unfairly attacked the BBC over their <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/BBC_Newsnight%27s_%22Dirty_tricks_and_toxic_waste_in_Ivory_Coast%22,_15min_video,_13_May_2009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handling</a> of the Trafigura affair, Assange <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGshmyKhcX4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly humiliated</a> him on stage.</p>

Guards in Kuwait had claimed that she had made a noose from her bedsheets, and repeatedly banged her head against the cage (she later could not remember this) so they placed her on suicide watch and prescribed anti-depression and anti-anxiety drugs. She remained on suicide watch in maximum security conditions at Quantico, but initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826013522/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/bradley-manning-keeping-sane-madness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> things were getting better:</p>

<p>In fact Manning would endure conditions amounting to torture for another nine months at Quantico: a guard stationed permanently outside her 6ft by 8ft (180cm by 240cm) cell; a toilet with no toilet paper (she had to shout for it when needed); only 20 minutes per day outside the cell, in full restraint (hands cuffed to a leather belt, legs in irons); nights spent under observation in fluorescent light, with guards regularly banging on the door for "security checks".</p>

<p>This was a sly reference to behind-the-scenes negitiations as WikiLeaks worked on their next big release, the Iraq War Logs (see below). WikiLeaks was demanding more time to redact documents. According to Der Spiegel&#8217;s John Goetz, their media partners were irritated by the delay.</p>

"They decided not to take responsibility for getting the raw data out to the public, that is in fact what appears our role, to get the raw data out as opposed to the cherries the organisations decided selectively to give out in relation to their stories."</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Is it going to be a serious response or is it going to simply put its head in the sand?"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within ten days the answer would be obvious. WikiLeaks was about to be hit with a bombshell. And the world&#8217;s media would soon have a perfect excuse to desert Assange en masse.</p>

<p>Until August 2010, the WikiLeaks website was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/02/21/wikileaks_bulletproof_hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> by a Swedish company called PRQ, which provided "highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services". In keeping with the anarchistic approach to a free Internet, PRQ recorded "almost no information about its clientele" and maintained "few if any of its own logs". Julian Assange still believed that Swedish laws guaranteed the world&#8217;s most secure Internet hosting, but he wanted to move WikiLeaks to another Swedish Internet Service Provider named Bahnhof, who housed their servers in the Pionen facility, a former underground nuclear fall-out shelter. Assange was also <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/22633870372" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to apply for Swedish residency ahead of WikiLeaks’ Iraq War Logs publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But on the morning of 21 August 201, Julian Assange woke up in Stockholm to find himself <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-11047025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">branded</a> a "<a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2010/8/21/895062/-Breaking:-Assange-accused-of-double-rape-in-Sweden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Double Rapist</a>" on media front pages around the world. So how did that happen?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 11 August 2010, Assange landed in the Swedish capital to negotiate a deal with Bahnhof. He was invited to stay at the empty apartment of a woman named Anna Ardin. Who was Anna Ardin? According to Rundle:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anna Ardin, 31, was the press secretary of the Brotherhood Movement, a once-conservative Christian group within the Swedish Social Democratic Party, now a centre for ‘third-worldist’ left liberation theology. Known for her exuberant enthusiasms, Ardin was or had been variously a feminist, a gender equality officer for the Uppsala University student union, an Israel–Palestine peace activist, an animal liberationist and the co-proprietor of Fever, a bisexual fetish nightclub.</p>

<div class="title">Anna Ardin with fetish footwear</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ardin had also worked with US-backed opposition groups in Cuba and Miami, fleeing from Havana after being <a href="https://proassange.blogspot.com/2012/08/assange-rape-accuser-has-history-with.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened</a> with deportation for "subversivee activities", and wrote anti-Castro articles for a US-linked publication in Sweden.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two nights after Assange arrived, on Friday 13 August, Ardin returned home and had consensual sex with him. Ardin later claimed that Assange had continued having sex with her, against her wishes, after a condom broke. But she continued happily socialising with him for days, and insisted he stay at her house, despite other offers of accommodation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, Saturday 14 August, Assange gave a speech at Stockholm&#8217;s Trade Union Headquarters, where Ardin acted as his press secretary. She later tweeted that Assange wanted to attend a late night crayfish party. In the early hours of Sunday morning she tweeted from the party:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">

<p>Another Swedish woman, Sofia Wilén, was in the front row of the Trade Union HQ audience, wearing a pink cashmere sweater and taking photos of Assange. During Assange&#8217;s speech, according to text messages later produced by Assange&#8217;s lawyers, Wilén texted a friend: "He looked at me!" Wilén later told police she had become interested in Assange after seeing him on TV.</p>

<div class="imageblock text-center">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Witnesses said that following Assange&#8217;s speech, Sofia Wilén pressured her way to an invite to the post-event lunch, where she flirted with Assange, who later said "one of the organizers stated that she was a volunteer for their organisation although they would later claim that this was not true". After lunch, Wilén and Assange went to an IMAX cinema together and "canoodled". Assange said she "kissed me and placed my hands on her breasts. She asked whether I was staying with [Anna Ardin] and seemed concerned by it in a manner that I found strange."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two days later, on Monday August 16th 2010, Assange and Wilén caught a train from Stockholm&#8217;s central station to her flat in Enköping. Assange&#8217;s bank cards had been frozen, so Wilén paid for his ticket. They had consensual sex and Assange, who felt he was in a secure location even though Wilén "knew an unusual amount of detail about me", stayed the night.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I would later discover that she had collected dozens of photos of me in the weeks before we even met. Her recent FLICKR photo account was filled with pages and pages of photos of me and no other person."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next morning, according to Rundle&#8217;s version, "something happened".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wilén would tell police that Assange began bareback [no condom] sex with her while she was asleep. As she woke, she said, “You better not have HIV,” to which he replied, “Of course not.” And they continued. According to Assange’s version, Wilén was half-asleep when sex began. Assange’s defence team would later allege that in a text message to a friend, Wilén also said she was half-asleep at the time.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to Assange:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I was certain "SW" was not asleep. I was also certain she expressly consented to unprotected sex before such intercourse started."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Tuesday 17 August, Ardin allegedly texted a friend who was looking for Assange: “He’s not here. He’s planned to have sex with the cashmere girl every evening, but not made it. Maybe he finally found time yesterday?”</p>

</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After having sex with Julian Assange, Sofia Wilén told friends that she was worried about the possibility of contracting a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD). She phoned Ardin&#8217;s house, reportedly trying to contact Assange, and the two women began exchanging information. Ardin then introduced Wilén to a friend, Irmeli Krans, who was a former council election colleague and a campaigning feminist police officer. Like Ardin, Krans was also a member of Sweden&#8217;s Social Democratic party (this will be important later).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Friday 20 August, Assange says he phoned Wilén because a friend said she was in hospital and wanted to talk to him. She asked him to meet her and get tested for an STD infection but "I was busy that day attempting to deal with the escalating political and legal threats against me from the Pentagon". Assange offered to get tested the following day (Saturday) but Wilén said she would go to the police and force him to get tested if he did not come to the hospital. After further discussion, Assange said she had agreed to meet at lunch the next day, when he agreed to get tested.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You can imagine my disbelief when I woke the next morning to the news that I had been arrested in my absence for "rape" and that police were "hunting" all over Stockholm for me."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what happened? After speaking on the phone with Assange on 20th August, Wilén went to Klara Police Station with Anna Ardin and policewoman Irmeli Krans, purportedly to force Julian to take an AIDS test. But Wilén said she was "shocked" and "railroaded" by police. Contrary to normal police procedures, Anna Ardin was allowed to sit in throughout Wilén’s police interview, which was also not video recorded (as per police recommendations) although a police report was produced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Krans prepared a statement accusing Assange of rape but Wilén refused to sign it. The police report said she was "upset" by the rape accusation and left the station.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wilén allegedly texted a friend at 14.25 on 20 August: “I did not want to put any charges against JA but the police wanted to get a grip on him.” At 17.26 another text said she was “shocked when they arrested JA because I only wanted him to take a test”. And the next day: “it was the police who fabricated the charges”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These text messages were recorded by Swedish police but never made public. Assange&#8217;s lawyers were never given a copy but were "permitted to see them at the police station and able to note down a number of them":</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next day, Saturday 21 August, Ardin made her own statement to the police. When asked to provide additional evidence, Ardin <a href="https://radsoft.net/rants/20210124,00.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly</a> returned to the police station with a torn condom (which would by then have been over a week old). Police later tested the condom and found it had no traces of genomic DNA. In other words, it had never been used.</p>

<p>Most of the details above were never revealed to the public by global media organisations who rushed to condemn Assange as a "rapist" and a "fugitive from justice". The damage to Julian Assange&#8217;s reputation - and WikiLeaks' public standing - was huge, immediate, long-lasting, and monumentally distracting from their other work. As Assange later complained, normal Swedish protections of privacy were simply thrown out the door:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The press was immediately and unlawfully informed that there was a warrant for my arrest for the “rape of two” women. The Swedish government prosecutor unlawfully, and without any subsequent explanation or remedy, immediately confirmed to the press that there was a live warrant for my arrest. The prosecutor&#8217;s breach triggered an avalanche of news reports. Within days there were millions of references online which associated my name with the word 'rape'. Immediately the police accusations were used to attack WikiLeaks' work and my reputation as its publisher. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates celebrated the news of my arrest warrant with a smile, telling reporters that the arrest “sounds like good news to me”. Various twitter accounts officially associated with the Pentagon spread descriptions of me as a “rapist” and a “fugitive”.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks attempted to push back against the avalanche of negative press. On 21 August they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100825052044/https://blog.wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an "official statement about the latest hot topic".</p>

<p>WikiLeaks also tweeted: "We were warned to expect 'dirty tricks.' Now, we have the first one." This tweet was later deleted, after complaints that it was not respectful to the women involved.</p>

<p>Facing a barrage of questions, the Swedish Prosecution Authority published a FAQ saying that Assange&#8217;s information had reached news media "in a way that the authority does not know" and the prosecutor&#8217;s office "merely confirmed the information". Observers <a href="http://amovingworld.blogspot.com/2010/08/how-was-leak-on-wikileaks-conducted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wondered</a> why prosecutors had not given journalists the standard "no comment" response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then another amazing thing happened. On the next day, Sunday 22 August 2010, the Swedish case against Assange was abruptly <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/08/sweden-clears-assange-of-rape-041333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a>. Swedish authorities cancelled the warrant for Julian Assange&#8217;s arrest.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A statement from Chief Prosecutor Eva Finne on the Swedish Prosecution Authority website said Finne "has come to the decision that Julian Assange is not suspected of rape" and the arrest warrant against him has been withdrawn.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A former Swedish chief prosecutor, Sven-Erik Alhem, <a href="http://www.skandinaviflorida.com/web/sif.nsf/d6plinks/JEIE-88KHYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the the actions of the prosecutors were "bizarre and confusing":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The arrest order was based on the assumption of probable cause, the strongest grade of suspicion of crime that is required for an arrest order, and later this probable cause suspicion is withdrawn without the appearence of any new information in the case.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an equally bizarre TV <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLy2UOaA0CU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a>, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution Authority insisted that no mistakes had been made and the case had been closed because "new evidence" had emerged. But while the arrest warrant had made global headlines, the "new evidence" supposedly proving Assange&#8217;s innocence was kept secret. Al Jazeera&#8217;s host asked if it was "normal procedure to accuse someone of rape and then two hours later say no, it&#8217;s not the case?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, according to the texts provided by Assange&#8217;s lawyers, Anna Ardin was urging Sofia Wilén to go public with her story so they could "shape public opinion" (the women&#8217;s identities were still secret: only Assange&#8217;s identity had been revealed). Ardin texted that they ought to sell their stories for money to a newspaper. Elections were being held in Sweden on 19 September 2010, and Ardin was (for the second time) seeking election to the Stockholm City Council as a Social Democrat party candidate. No doubt the extra publicity would have helped her campaign.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 26 August, Chief Prosecutor Eva Finne repeated emphatically that the evidence provided did not constitute a crime and the case was closed:</p>
</div>

<p>“There is no suspicion of any crime whatsoever.”</p>

The next day, Friday 27 August 2010, a full two weeks after Assange first had sex with Ardin, a high profile Social Democrat politician named Claes Borgström was appointed counsel for the two women: he applied to re-open the investigation with a new prosecutor in the Swedish city of Gothenberg (nearly 400 km from Stockholm). On the following day, the two women allegedly confirmed by text that their new lawyer had negotiated a contract with Sweden&#8217;s biggest tabloid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Borgström was also running as a Social Democrat party candidate at the coming elections, and could have become a government cabinet member if his party had won (national and local elections are held simultaneously in Sweden). According to Rundle, Claes Borgström was "not only the Social Democratic Party’s gender equality spokesperson, but a major driver of Sweden’s Sexual Offences Act 2005". And the new prosecutor, Marrianne Ny, was a sex crime expert who "had headed a crime development unit whose brief was to explore ways in which sex crime law might be changed or extended". There were clearly political and career gains to be reaped from the high profile Assange case.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fortnight later, on 1 September, Ny would not only announce that Wilén’s minor rape accusation had been reinstated, but another one had been added – the physical argy-bargy that Ardin had herself represented as consensual (if disliked) now made Assange liable to a charge of sexual coercion, another specifically Swedish ‘in-between’ law, perhaps comparable to indecent assault.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To successfully appeal a non-prosecution in Sweden is not unusual, but the coercion accusation surprised everyone. When journalists asked Borgström how the new accusations squared with earlier statements by the women that confirmed Assange was not a rapist, Borgström replied: “They’re not lawyers. They don’t know what rape is.” In Ardin’s case this was patently untrue. As gender equality officer at Uppsala University, she had literally written the book on the matter – redrafting the union’s gender equality manual.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although WikiLeaks staff and media partners were still working on their next big release, Julian Assange cancelled his other commitments and remained in Sweden for five weeks, until 27 September 2010, when his lawyer said he had legal permission to leave the country. Nevertheless, for years to come, critics would falsely claim that Assange "fled Sweden to escape sex charges".</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">NOTE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Arrest warrants were issued because Assange was wanted for questioning, but he was never actually "charged" by Sweden with any crime.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange gave an interview to Swedish police on 30 August 2010 in relation to Anna Ardin&#8217;s claim, which was the only remaining allegation at the time. On 8 September 2010, Bjorn Hurtig, Assange&#8217;s Swedish lawyer, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2010-09-wikileaks-founder-free-sweden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that an investigation was still under way but his client had been given no summons for questioning, meaning Assange was free to do what he liked, including going abroad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the same day, the head of the Swedish military intelligence service (“MUST”) publicly denounced WikiLeaks in an <a href="https://wikileaks.org/IMG/html/Affidavit_of_Julian_Assange.html#sdfootnote125sym" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> titled "WikiLeaks A Threat To Our Soldiers". Assange "became increasingly concerned about Sweden’s <a href="https://rickrozoff.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/2380/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close relationship</a> to the US in military and intelligence matters". A  trusted intelligence source warned him that US intelligence agents had told their Swedish counterparts that intelligence-sharing arrangements could be cut off if Assange was given shelter.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange said the sex accusations were part of "a clear set-up" and had caused damage to WikiLeaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"This entire rape investigation has been conducted without my input," he complained.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before leaving Sweden, Assange <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/08/30/wikileaks-servers-move-to-underground-nuclear-bunker/?sh=6d22d8631e32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finalised</a> the movement of WikiLeaks servers to the Pionen nuclear bunker.

<p>Julian Assange&#8217;s dramatic soujourn in Sweden had one final twist: when he finally boarded a flight from Sweden to Germany, his "suitcase, laptops, privileged attorney-client communications and other important information belonging to WikiLeaks disappeared". Assange later stated that the disappeared WikiLeaks material "included shocking evidence of a serious war crime; the massacre of
more than sixty women and children by US military forces in Garani, Afghanistan".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite frantic efforts by many people over the following days, no trace of the disappeared luggage could be found, even though Assange still had a verified check-in docket. Airport staff said they had "never encountered anything like this before”. The luggage was not just lost; it appeared to have never existed in their systems.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange continued flying from Germany to London, where he continued preparing for the Iraq War Logs release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 18 November 2010, the new Swedish Prosecutor Marianne Ny ordered the detention of Julian Assange "with probable cause, suspected of rape, three cases of sexual molestation and illegal coercion". A European Arrest Warrant was issued. Although Assange had been interviewed by Swedish police, had remained in Sweden for a month after Marianne Ny took over the case, and had left the country because he was not summoned by Ny for questioning, the Swedish Prosecuting Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190502114026/https://www.aklagare.se/en/nyheter&#8212;&#8203;press/media/the-assange-matter/chronology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisted</a> that a new warrant was required "as it has been impossible to interview him during the investigation".</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">

<dd>
<p>Assange&#8217;s Swedish lawyer later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B24FY20101203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Assange had "made himself available to speak with Swedish authorities, including the prosecutor handling the case, at an embassy abroad, but this offer had been rejected". Assange had earlier "offered to travel to Sweden to answer questions but authorities could not make themselves available at any of the suggested times".</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Astonishingly, Sweden also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/30/interpol-wanted-notice-julian-assange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> an Interpol Red Notice. Legal observers wondered why Sweden did not simply go and question Assange in Britain, as happened frequently in such European Arrest Warrant cases. The simple answer may be that UK Crown Prosecutors advised them to stay away.</p>

<p>Dated 30 November, the entry reads: "SEX CRIMES" and says the warrant has been issued by the international public prosecution office in Gothenburg, Sweden. "If you have any information contact your national or local police." It reads: "Wanted: Assange, Julian Paul," and gives his birthplace as Townsville, Australia.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s lawyers appealed the Swedish arrest warrant all the way to the Sweden&#8217;s Supreme Court, arguing that there was no such thing as "minor rape", that "rape" was a mistranslation from Swedish, and that the allegations did not meet English or European legal definition of "rape". But on 2 December 2010, the Swedish Supreme Court decided not to hear Assange&#8217;s case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shocking lack of due process continued. A Freedom of Information request from Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201014202854/https://amp.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/10/uk-prosecutors-admit-destroying-key-emails-from-julian-assange-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that a lawyer for the UK Crown Prosecuting Service, Paul Close, "had, unaccountably, advised the Swedes in 2010 or 2011 not to visit London to interview Assange". Close <a href="https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2018/02/13/news/few_documents_many_mysteries_how_our_foia_case_is_unveiling_the_questionable_handling_of_the_julian_assange_case-188758273/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to the Swedish prosecutors on 25 January 2011:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“My <strong>earlier advice</strong> remains, that in my view it would not be prudent for the Swedish authorities to try to interview the defendant in the UK”.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not clear when this "earlier advice" was provided, or what exactly it said. But on 13 January 2011 Close wrote:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Please do not think that the case is being dealt with as just another extradition request”.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In yet another astonishing turn of events, all Paul Close&#8217;s correspondence about Assange with Swedish prosecutors was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201014202854/https://amp.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/10/uk-prosecutors-admit-destroying-key-emails-from-julian-assange-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mysteriously deleted</a> when he retired in 2014.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It seems quite possible that UK Crown Prosecutors were telling Sweden not to come and question Assange in London from the day they issued a European Arrest Warrant. And yet for years Assange was publicly condemned for refusing to go to Sweden, where he would have been immediately jailed and <a href="https://justice4assange.com/extraditing-assange.html#UKEASIER" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely</a> quickly extradited to the USA, who had a sealed indictment waiting.</p>

<div class="dlist">

<p>Assange repeatedly offered to go to Sweden to be interviewed, provided that he was given assurances that he would not be "onward extradited" to the USA. Sweden refused to give that assurance. Sweden has a <a href="https://professorsblogg.com/2012/12/18/the-assange-extradition-case-revisited-part-iii-of-the-series-sweden-versus-assange-insider-analyses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history</a> of near-total compliance with US extradition requests and has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/11/09/sweden-violated-torture-ban-cia-rendition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assisted</a> with CIA renditions and torture.</p>
