<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the day after the 2016 US election, Ellen Ratner, the sister of deceased WikiLeaks lawyer Michael Ratner, appeared on US television and <a href="https://youtu.be/0M3Z4eE6cJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that she had spent three hours talking with Julian Assange just a few days earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"He said the leaks were not from the Russians. They were from an internal source from the Hillary campaign or from somone who knew Hillary, an enemy. He does not think they&#8217;re from Russians. Russia got credit for something WikiLeaks should have got credit for."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ratner was more or less <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190801062221/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M3Z4eE6cJA&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterating</a> what Craig Murray had previously <a href="https://sputniknews.com/20161102/craig-murray-dnc-podesta-1046973468.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>. At any rate, on 17 December 2016, a Dallas businessman named Ed Butowsky contacted the family of Seth Rich and told them that he had a message for them from Julian Assange. He said he had received the message via a mutual friend, Ellen Ratner, who denied ever giving him such a message. The message, Butowsky said, was that Seth Rich had been a WikiLeaks source for the DNC leaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This visit triggered a series of events that lead to years of complex legal battles. According to Butowsky&#8217;s <a href="http://lawflog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019.07.15-Amended-complaint-stamped.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a>, Seth Rich&#8217;s father Joel initially said that he already knew <strong>both</strong> his sons, Seth and Aaron, were involved in the leaks:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During that conversation, Mr. Rich told Mr. Butowsky that he already knew that his sons were involved in the DNC email leak, but he and his wife just wanted to know who murdered Seth. Mr. Rich said he was reluctant to go public with Seth’s and Aaron’s role in leaking the emails because “we don’t want anyone to think our sons were responsible for getting Trump elected."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Butowsky offered to provide the Rich family with a private detective to help them find out who killed their son. The Rich family had previously received pro bono public relations assistance from a right-wing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Burkman#Seth_Rich_murder_conspiracy_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraudster</a> named Jack Burkman, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714232639/http://dcist.com/2017/03/seth_rich_russian_conspiracy_burkman.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distanced</a> themselves from him after he claimed that Seth had been killed by Russians who were covering up evidence of their DNC hacking. Butowsky hired Rod Wheeler, a former homicide detective with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington DC, who were nominally in charge of the murder investigation. Both Butowsky and Wheeler had links to FOX News.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 16 May 2017 FOX News published <a href="https://archive.is/tLllD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an explosive story</a> about an anonymous US federal investigator who claimed to have reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of Seth Rich’s computer, including emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. It quoted ex-detective Rod Wheeler saying:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks. I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story provoked a huge uproar, with politicians and journalists alike condemning it. ABC News <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/fbi-involved-seth-rich-case-officials/story?id=47565705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that "FBI and other law enforcement officials" were dismissing the story as "a conspiracy theory":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to officials with knowledge of the matter, the FBI is not investigating the unsolved murder of Seth Rich last year in what agents have determined was “a possible attempted robbery” gone wrong. Asked about the possible connection between Rich and WikiLeaks, one official told ABC News that “the only place I&#8217;ve seen that is through the conspiracy theories online."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FOX News retracted their story a week later and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/statement-on-coverage-of-seth-rich-murder-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apologised</a>. After multiple <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/online/fox-news-reporter-who-wrote-retracted-seth-rich-story-still-pursuing-the-conspiracy-on-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints</a> from CNN journalist Oliver Darcy, the author Malia Zimmerman also deleted her tweets about the story. The Washington Times also <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/30/retraction-aaron-rich-and-murder-seth-rich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracted</a> an article, written by retired US Navy admiral James Lyons, who <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/seth-rich-apology-731426/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that it was “well known in the intelligence circles” that both Seth and Aaron Rich had “downloaded” the thousands of emails taken from the DNC in 2016 and that Wikileaks had paid them for the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The family of Seth Rich sent Rod Wheeler a cease and desist letter. Wheeler responded by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/rod-wheeler-seth-rich-murder-fox-news-lawsuit-2017-8?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing</a> FOX News for mis-quoting him (he later dropped the case).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now the Rich family was being represented by a "family spokesman" named <a href="https://www.netrootsnation.org/profile/brad-bauman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Bauman</a>, who was <a href="https://crimereads.com/conspiracy-theory-seth-rich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as "a PR consultant who had kicked around Democratic politics for years". Bauman <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/fbi-involved-seth-rich-case-officials/story?id=47565705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the media:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“So much of the conspiracy theory has been dependent on the allegation of federal investigators being involved, and the fact that the FBI has not and never had been involved with this investigation is critical to understanding just how false these conspiracy theories are."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was simply not true. The FBI was most <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/fbi-asks-court-for-66-years-to-release-information-from-seth-richs-computer_4826785.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly</a> involved. At that time, however, journalists just didn&#8217;t have the <a href="https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/ZDZ255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a> to prove it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ed Butowsky&#8217;s court filings noted how the Rich family&#8217;s behaviour had "changed suddenly" once Brad Bauman got involved:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Under coercion from Mr. Bauman and the lawyer Defendants named in this lawsuit, Joel Rich stopped speaking with Mr. Butowsky and the Rich family started attacking Mr. Butowsky publicly (albeit not by name). Prior to the time of Mr. Bauman&#8217;s involvement, the Rich family acknowledged to friends and relatives that Seth and Aaron were involved in the DNC email leak, but then they suddenly changed their story. On information and belief, Mr. Butowksy alleges that Joel, Mary, and Aaron Rich were told that Aaron could be charged with felony computer crimes if they did not cooperate with their new handlers, i.e., Mr. Bauman and the lawyer Defendants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kim Dotcom <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=Tm-Vt8RDJEk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> that the Rich family&#8217;s behaviour change was "very suspicious":</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So to me it was very suspicious how they have dealt with anyone who was trying to shed some light on this and you read between the lines and you see how they they react to things. And also their relationships, the fact that this guy Baumann gets involved, who is really a PR person for the DNC, and now runs the whole communications strategy and defends and basically stifles any kind of conversation about this topic. The fact that the family allowed that guy to get involved when there was some, you know, at the very least, if I was the parent of Seth Rich, I would would be saying, well, I mean this whole robbery story just doesn&#8217;t add up.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile Sy Hersh, the Pulitzer-winning journalist who exposed the 1968 My Lai massacre in Vietnam, was also investigating the Seth Rich murder and broader claims of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Hersh had been communicating with Ed Butowsky since a mutual friend put them in touch in late January 2017. Hersh <a href="https://bigleaguepolitics.com/audio-seymour-hersh-states-seth-rich-wikileaks-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Butowsky that he had also seen a secret FBI report that identified Seth Rich as a WikiLeaks source.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, Butowsky was secretly recording his conversations with Hersh. In August 2017 an audio file of this conversation was published online. This forced Hersh to abandon the story because his sources were now in danger.</p>

<p>In late 2018 the NSA sent a FOI <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190814191144/debunkingrodwheelersclaims.net/letter-from-nsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response</a> to Butowsky&#8217;s lawyer Ty Clevenger, saying they had identified 15 documents (32 pages) that matched his request for information about Seth Rich, but they were all marked SECRET or TOP SECRET - which meant than none would be released. It seemed strange that documents about a supposedly routine DC murder investigation would be marked TOP SECRET - perhaps they were part of the WikiLeaks/Assange investigations and only peripherally mentioned Seth Rich? Who knew.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now Butowsky was frustrated. He said he felt he was just an unlucky chump who had tried to help out the Rich family and ended up in a convoluted mess. He said he had spent over $800,000 on lawsuits. But he also had some suspiciously close connections to the Trump White House team. In 2020, when Trump lost power, Butowsky began <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ed-butowsky-fox-news-seth-rich-npr-cnn-dismiss-lawsuits-1078508/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping</a> his lawsuits and publicly <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/butowsky-couch-retract-claims-about-late-democratic-national-committee-staffer-seth-rich_3661156.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracting</a> his claims about the Seth Rich case.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lawyer for Butowsky told Rolling Stone that Butowsky had “decided to re-prioritize his life” and “does not wish to discuss the litigation any further.” The lawyer, Ty Clevenger, said Butowsky’s views about Seth Rich and the 2016 election had not changed. And Clevenger himself went on to dispute Rolling Stone‘s reporting on the case, claiming “the FBI has been hiding evidence from Seth Rich’s laptop, just like the FBI was hiding evidence from Hunter Biden’s laptop. I wouldn’t be surprised if the evidence was kept in the same room.”</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ty Clevenger continued lodging Freedom of Information (FOI) requests with the FBI on behalf of another Texan businessman, Brian Huddleston. The FBI continued denying that they had any information about Seth Rich. But then a series of emails between FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page - titled "Seth Rich" and dated just a month after his murder - <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JW-v-DOJ-Strzok-Page-Prod-16-00154.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned up</a> in response to another FBI FOI request from Judicial Watch.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 14 February 2017 Julian Assange began publicly using his own Twitter account, @JulianAssange (first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100826110910/https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up</a> in 2010 and later changed to @DefendAssange by his legal team). His first tweet ridiculed the suspiciously common rumour - prompted by Ecuador temporarily cutting off his Internet access - that he was dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By this time the CIA had lost control of their "crown jewels" - a highly sophisticated set of cyber weapons which they used to hack others and launch cyber attacks. US intelligence officials later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cia-wikileaks-leak-idUSKBN16F2CZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they had been investigating the leak since 2016. WikiLeaks was now preparing to publish these complex CIA tools, which they labeled "Vault 7". Assange reportedly wanted to cut a secret deal with the US government.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange made clear through the lawyer that he would never compromise his sources, or stop publishing information, but was willing to consider concessions like redactions.</p>

<p>According to articles published by <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/394049-coming-up-tuesdays-rising-how-the-doj-almost-offered-an-immunity-deal-to-julian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill</a> in 2018, Assange&#8217;s team contacted a former Clinton Justice Department official, Adam Waldman, who visited Assange in London three times while negotiating a deal via the US Justice Department&#8217;s counterintelligence section chief David Laufman.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the negotiations warmed, Assange unleashed his first leak on March 7, 2017, with about 8,000 pages of documents on the CIA’s cyber weapons. It did not deter the talks, however, since U.S. officials were more concerned about what he might release next.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first batch of Vault 7 documents were titled "Year Zero".  WikiLeaks posted an encrypted archive online and only revealed the password a week later, on 7 March 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had been circulating among "former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive." WikiLeaks said the source "wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons" since these tools raise questions that "urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA&#8217;s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, Assaange&#8217;s secret discussions with the US government continued:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Dear David, I relayed our conversations to Assange and he had a generally positive view of it,” Waldman wrote Laufman in mid-March.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shuttle diplomacy soon resulted in an informal offer — known in government parlance as a “Queen for a Day” proffer — in which Assange identified what he wanted and what he might give.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange was prepared to negotiate redactions and also help the CIA explore why their Vault 7 files were not fully secured. He was also prepared to discuss the 2016 DNC Leaks and provide evidence to support his claim that Russia was not WikiLeaks&#8217;s source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But then FBI Director James Comey personally stepped in and abruptly <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/394036-How-Comey-intervened-to-kill-Wikileaks-immunity-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed</a> the deal. Comey had been notified by Democrat Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<p>WikiLeaks continued releasing Vault 7 information in 24 stages, with a new CIA tool documented and explained every week or so, until early September 2017. A month later they released "Vault 8" which was the source code and development logs for "Hive", one of the CIA&#8217;s malware tools. Other source code was not released: WikiLeaks wanted people to see what the CIA had secretly been doing, but did not want to give other malicious actors the tools to copy them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With attention-grabbing names like "AngelFire" and "Butal Kangaroo", the CIA tools had a long list of capabilities including malware, viruses, weaponised "zero day" exploits and remote control systems for phones, cars, smart TVs, web browsers and operating systems. These tools gave the CIA astonishing opportunities to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. They could even to make it look like other state actors (e.g. Russia or China) were the real authors of CIA cyber attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While technical experts were shocked by the sophistication of the Vault 7 tools, WikiLeaks' explanations of highly complex software were not so easy for the general public to digest. Mainstream media interest was muted.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In July 2022 former CIA software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schulte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joshua Schulte</a> was convicted of leaking the Vault 7 documents to WikiLeaks. His prosecution was a farce, with court testimony revealing a totally dysfunctional work environment at the CIA&#8217;s supposedly elite hacking team; immature co-workers were constantly playing pranks, shooting toy guns at each other, stealing from each others cubicles, loudly squabbling and even making death threats. It was an environment where top secret data could easily go missing. A CIA report later found multiple security failures that could have lead to the Vault 7 leak.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the wake of the first 2017 Vault 7 publications and Pompeo&#8217;s angry rant, senior Trump administration officials began plotting to kidnap or even assassinate Julian Assange. As a team of Yahoo News journalists later <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some senior officials inside the CIA and the Trump administration even discussed killing Assange, going so far as to request “sketches” or “options” for how to assassinate him. Discussions over kidnapping or killing Assange occurred “at the highest levels” of the Trump administration, said a former senior counterintelligence official. “There seemed to be no boundaries.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CIA plans also included "extensive spying on WikiLeaks associates, sowing discord among the group’s members, and stealing their electronic devices". Officials wanted to legally redefine WikiLeaks and supporters like Glenn Greenwald as "information brokers" in order to remove First Amendment protections and give a green light to increased surveillance efforts. There were even <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/05/14/american-sheldon-adelsons-us-spy-julian-assange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussions</a> about poisoning Assange.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pompeo and other top agency leaders “were completely detached from reality because they were so embarrassed about Vault 7,” said a former Trump national security official. “They were seeing blood.”</p>

<p>Later in 2017, when Ecuadorian officials privately <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-assange-exclusive/exclusive-ecuador-attempted-to-give-assange-diplomat-post-in-russia-document-idUSKCN1M12R5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the possibility of officially designating Julian Assange as an Ecuadorian diplomat and transferring him to their Russian embassy, the CIA rushed out plans to block his departure:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those included potential gun battles with Kremlin operatives on the streets of London, crashing a car into a Russian diplomatic vehicle transporting Assange and then grabbing him, and shooting out the tires of a Russian plane carrying Assange before it could take off for Moscow. (U.S. officials asked their British counterparts to do the shooting if gunfire was required, and the British agreed, according to a former senior administration official.)</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spies were placed in streets and buildings all around the Ecuadorian embassy in London. One former senior official called the level of overkill "beyond comical".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>“It got to the point where every human being in a three-block radius was working for one of the intelligence services — whether they were street sweepers or police officers or security guards.”</p>

Another source told the <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/05/14/american-sheldon-adelsons-us-spy-julian-assange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greyzone</a> that the US ambassador to Ecuador had told authorities in Quito that he knew about the plan, and warned them against executing it.</p>

The computer contained detailed information about the plan to legally allow Assange to leave the embassy.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But how did the CIA and US officials even know what Ecuadorian officials were secretly discussing with Julian Assange within the diplomatic confines of the Ecuadorian embassy?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shortly after Julian Assange sought asylum in 2012, President Correa appointed a Spanish security firm named Undercover Global S.L. (UC Global) to manage security at Ecuador&#8217;s London embassy. A few years later, after attending a security fair in Las Vegas, David Morales, a co-founder of UC Global, told his staff that he had turned to the “dark side” and the company was now "playing in the first division”.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>US billionaire Sheldon Adelson, owner of the Las Vegas Sands casino and a close friend of Donald Trump, gave UC Global a contract to manage security on his $70 million yacht. This contract appears to have been a covert method of channeling funds for more sinister activities (Morales was arrested in late 2019: a Spanish court is still hearing his case).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In early March 2017, when Assange was still negotiating the Vault 7 release, Morales travelled to the USA and stayed in Alexandria, Virginia, close to the CIA headquarters in Langley. According to the <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/05/14/american-sheldon-adelsons-us-spy-julian-assange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greyzone</a>, Morales was liaising with Adelson’s top bodyguard, an Israeli-American named Zohar Lahav, and Brian Nagel, a former associate director of the US Secret Service who was now the director of global security for Las Vegas Sands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spying inside the embassy soon caused serious problems in the outside world. Pamela Anderson discovered that her phone and email accounts were compromised after UC Global staff saw her writing them on a piece of paper inside the embassy. Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi was shocked when embassy security guards - for the first time - asked her to surrender her bag and everything inside it. She later discovered that phone calls, emails, and texts from her editors were failing to go through.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>“No one could explain this disruption. I wonder if it had anything to do with these espionage activities. To this day I cannot say.”</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>UC Global staff even spied on a US Congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, who <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/rohrabacher-confirms-he-offered-trump-pardon-to-assange-for-proof-russia-didnt-hack-dnc-email-131438007.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> he was visiting Assange as an official emissary of President Trump. WikiLeaks lawyers, who were present at the August 2017 meeting, said Rohrabacher offered Assange a presidential pardon in return for proof that Russia did not hack the DNC server.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Morales also asked his technicians to install an external streaming access point "so that all of the recordings could be accessed instantly by the United States" and also to install stickers that prevented windows from vibrating, "to make it easier for the CIA to record conversations with their laser microphones". The UC Global boss began traveling to the USA at least once a month, allegedly handing over recorded materials to people he only referred to as “the Americans.” IP addresses from some of Morales' emails <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2020/01/21/inenglish/1579611351_198492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> they were sent from "The Venetian", Adelson’s top hotel resort in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>UC Global staff became increasingly concerned about the legality of the tasks they were expected to perform. They were being asked to spy on and conceal evidence from their own clients, the same Ecuadorian officials who paid UC Global to keep their embassy secure. At one stage security staff were even asked to fetch a baby&#8217;s daiper from the rubbish because "the Americans" wanted to analyze the DNA and see if Assange was the father.

<p>Moreno <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/10/12/ecuadorian-president-lenin-morenos-assault-on-human-rights-and-judicial-independence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> judges at will. Street crime escalated and prisoners rioted as Ecuador&#8217;s economy steadily declined. In October 2019, when Moreno tried to abolish government fuel subsidies and impose harsh austerity measures, it triggered a wave of massive protests that left eight people dead and over 1,300 injured. The government was forced to temporarily relocate from the capital Quito to Guayaquil.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the time the Covid19 pandemic hit in early 2020, Ecuador was already an economic disaster. Families dumped infected corpses in the streets until the government began distributing cardboard coffins. By the end of the year, the country of just 14 million had recorded over 200,000 cases and 14,000 deaths. Vaccinations were slow to arrive and government estimates of Covid19 fatalities were reportedly only 13% of the harsh reality. Moreno&#8217;s popularity dropped to a record low 5%, with less than 3% of citizens believing anything he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, relations with the United States flourished. In June 2018, US Vice President Mike Pence travelled to Quito for a meeting with President Moreno, who agreed to purchase US weapons, helicopters, and other equipment, and to increase military co-operation on training and intelligence sharing. A White House statement <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/04/exclusive-leaked-assange-court-transcript-sheds-light-on-us-backed-ecuadorian-expulsion-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Pence "raised the issue of Mr Assange with President Moreno. It was a constructive conversation. They agreed to remain in close coordination on the potential next steps going forward.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreno also withdrew Ecuador from the ALBA trading bloc of socialist Latin American nations (even though it was head-quartered in Quito), withdrew his diplomats from Caracas and formally recognised the US puppet Juan Guido as President of Venezuela. He even allowed US military planes to use Ecuador&#8217;s military airstrip on the Galápagos Islands, triggering further protests.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of President Moreno&#8217;s first overseas visitors in May 2017 was Paul Manafort, the former campaign chief of President Donald Trump. According to the New York Times, Manafort unsuccessfully attempted to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/manafort-tried-to-make-deal-with-ecuador-on-wikileaks-assange-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negotiate</a> an agreement for Ecuador to hand over Assange. Months later, Manafort was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted</a> on multiple charges resulting from his consulting work for Ukraine&#8217;s former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych (overthrown with US support in 2014). He spent over a year in prison before President Trump pardoned him in late 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In November 2018 the Guardian newspaper falsely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/manafort-held-secret-talks-with-assange-in-ecuadorian-embassy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Julian Assange had met Paul Manafort inside the embassy at least three times - "in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016" - and even suggested that Manafort might have been a source for the 2016 DNC Leaks. Although Manafort&#8217;s name was never entered into the embassy visitor logs, the Guardian&#8217;s sources seemed to have extremely vivid memories:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manafort’s 2016 visit to Assange lasted about 40 minutes, one source said, adding that the American was casually dressed when he exited the embassy, wearing sandy-coloured chinos, a cardigan and a light-coloured shirt&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previously unreported Manafort-Assange connection is likely to be of interest to Mueller, who has been investigating possible contacts between WikiLeaks and associates of Trump including the political lobbyist Roger Stone and Donald Trump Jr.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This article by Luke Harding and Dan Collyns was absolute, total rubbish. Paul Manafort never once visited the embassy. WikiLeaks immediately offered to bet the Guardian a million dollars - and Julian Assange&#8217;s head! - if they could prove otherwise. Years later, the story still remains online, unretracted, with no apology from Guardian editors.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same Guardian propaganda team, collaborating with anti-Correa journalists in Ecuador, had previously published an embarrassingly ridiculous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/operation-hotel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of articles</a> about Assange&#8217;s life in the embassy. The May 2018 "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/julian-assange-ecuador-london-embassy-how-he-became-unwelcome-guest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Hotel</a>" articles - again based on leaks and gossip from UC Global staff and Moreno government officials - criticized Rafael Correa&#8217;s government for spending over $5 million to protect Julian Assange while the Australian was allegedly being visited by "hackers" and "Russian-affiliated" guests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Correa&#8217;s government had asked UC Global to install spy equipment to protect its embassy and staff as well as Assange. But the Guardian articles insinuated that the invasive surveillance had some other sinister motive. Of course there was no mention of the even more sophisticated and intrusive equipment that was installed to help UC Global&#8217;s "American friends".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guardian claimed that Julian Assange had compromised the embassy’s network security:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2014, the company hired to film Assange’s visitors was warning the Ecuadorian government that he was “intercepting and gathering information from the embassy and the people who worked there”.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact it was the UC Global staff themselves who were “intercepting and gathering information from the embassy and the people who worked there” - and sending their information to the CIA! WikiLeaks called the Guardian assertions “an anonymous libel aligned with the current UK-US government onslaught against Mr Assange”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Hotel Ecuador stories also repeatedly tried to frame Assange as a Russian agent:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is these visitor logs that will interest Mueller. He is reportedly close to indicting Russian hackers allegedly behind the raid on the Democrats’ electronic servers and seems to view WikiLeaks as an integral part of the Kremlin’s multifaceted espionage operation. The FBI has interviewed at least one source close to Operation Guest, it is understood.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact Robert Mueller&#8217;s Russiagate investigation was never able to prove any connection between Russia and WikiLeaks. His report stated that "with respect to WikiLeaks and Assange, this Office determined the admissible evidence to be insufficient on both the agreement and knowledge prongs." He never even tried to interview anyone from WikiLeaks.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By March 2018, Julian Assange&#8217;s personal Twitter account was discussing a wide range of political issues. He hotly contested the UK government&#8217;s official version of the Salisbury novichok poisonings, and staunchly supported the protest rights of pro-independence activists in Catalonia. He was also digging into the identities of mysterious Russiagate figures like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joseph-mifsud-audio-russia-investigation-disappearance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph Mifsud</a>. But after posting a tweet criticising the Spanish government&#8217;s violent response to the Catalan protests, Assange once again found his Internet access cut off by Ecuador.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">

<img src="2018wltweet.png" alt="2018wltweet">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreno&#8217;s officials also banned visitors and phone calls, effectively shutting off access to the outside world. President Moreno said Assange was "in breach of the terms of his asylum", even though such "terms" had never existed (and do not exist under international asylum laws). Assange responded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/world/americas/julian-assange-ecuador-lawsuit.html?module=inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing</a> Ecuador for "violating his fundamental rights."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/979124333091196928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/979397620903813121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> that Assange had ever signed a "gag order" or made any agreement to refrain from political commentary as a condition of his refuge in the embassy.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a few months Assange&#8217;s asylum remained secure, largely thanks to the personal support of Ecuador&#8217;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maria Fernanda Espinosa. It was her idea to grant Assange Ecuadorian citizenship in 2017 (Moreno later revoked it). But after Espinosa moved jobs in June 2018 to become the president of the UN General Assembly, Assange&#8217;s life inside the embassy quickly became intolerable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to former Ecuadorian embassy staffer <a href="https://jacobin.com/2019/10/julian-assange-fidel-narvaez-ecuador-moreno" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidel Narvaez</a>, Moreno&#8217;s new embassy staff isolated Assange and "tried to break him down, so that he would leave the embassy of his own accord".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"When the isolation started arousing international condemnation, they tried to impose the so-called “protocol,” which was an outrageous prison regime of putting banana peels all over the floor to provoke him and get an excuse to kick him out. That was one of the strategies. Another was to defame him in order to justify his expulsion, and to approach the British and the Americans in order to hand Julian over."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreno, who repeatedly called Assange “a stone in my shoe”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/31/julian-assange-ecuador-president-lenin-moreno?CMP=share_btn_tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> journalists that the Australian&#8217;s expulsion from the embassy was being actively discussed with UK and US officials. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/06/ecuador-says-uk-has-given-guarantees-for-assange-to-leave-embassy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he had received written assurance from Britain that Assange would not be extradited to a country where his life would be in danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Let’s not forget the conditions of his asylum prevent him from speaking about politics or intervening in the politics of other countries. That’s why we cut his communication.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assange&#8217;s communications were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/16/ecuador-embassy-tells-assange-clean-bathroom-feed-the-cat-do-laundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partially restored</a> in October 2018, but harsh new rules were imposed: Assange was only allowed to use the embassy wifi for his personal computer and phone; visits had to be approved three days in advance; and he was barred from activities which could be “considered as political or interfering with the internal affairs of other states”. They even threatened to take away his cat, which was soon given to Assange family members for safe-keeping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most disturbingly, a memo seen by the Guardian openly discussed the possibility of British police being invited inside the embassy:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the memo, the embassy “reserved the right to authorise security personnel to seize equipment” or ask the British authorities to enter the embassy and do so. Any attempt to bring such equipment into the embassy would be reported as a “security breach and reported to the competent British authorities.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Assange&#8217;s appeal against these restrictions was dismissed by a Spanish court, he escalated his case to the US-dominated Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. They also found against him (in March 2019).</p>

<p>In February 2019, hundreds of private emails, photos and text messages from Lenin Moreno and his wife were <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6919797/Was-Julian-Assange-expelled-embassy-leaked-picture-lobster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> to a site called INApapers.org.

Moreno said that Assange had again "violated the conditions of his asylum" and that he would "take a decision" on him "in the short term".

<p>On 10 April Kristinn Hrafnsson <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/10/inenglish/1554906053_635126.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that WikiLeaks and Assange had been the targets of a €3 million blackmail attempt. The extortionists appeared to have some 90 thousand compromised documents including legal, medical, and personal information about Assange, along with images and video from inside the embassy. The case was being investigated by Spanish authorities, as three Spanish nationals were involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WikiLeaks lawyers <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/457967-assange-lawyer-espionage-blackmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believed</a> the case to be a conspiracy involving Ecuadorian officials and Promsecurity, an Ecuadorean company which Lenin Moreno had put in charge of embassy surveillance in May 2018 (replacing UC Global). This attempted blackmail lead circuitously to the arrest of UC Global boss David Morales, with two separate Spanish court cases <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/07/09/inenglish/1562663427_224669.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digging</a> for the truth.

Then Ecuador&#8217;s Ambassador to the UK invited the Metropolitan Police into the embassy. Julian Assange shouted "This is unlawful, I am not leaving." He was forcibly dragged out by five officers who bundled him into a waiting van. He was carrying a copy of Gore Vidal&#8217;s "History of the National Security State" and shouted to the nearby crowd of gathered police, journalists and supporters: "the UK has no sovereignty" and "the UK must resist this attempt by the Trump administration&#8230;&#8203;"</p>
